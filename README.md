### Inspiration for The Curious Quoran: A Cross-Resource Recommender for Hungry Minds


For many of us, Quora is a beloved online repository of knowledge - a virtual meetingplace for hungry minds. True to its tagline, Quora is *the best place to get your questions answered.* Quora democratizes the knowledge, stories and intellectual resources of some of the most interesting and accomplished people in the world, from private individuals across the planet to public figures (Jimmy Wales! Sheryl Sandberg!)

My work is motivated by frequently asked Quora questions of the form: "*How / where can I learn more about ____*"; my goal is to augment the endogenous functionality of Quora's Stack Overflow-esque question and answer format by identifying latent user interests and recommending a curated set of resources from the following: Project Gutenberg ebook repository, Khan Academy lessons, Coursera courses and iTunes podcasts, thereby empowering autodidacts and curious individuals with access to the internet to continue their education free of charge.
