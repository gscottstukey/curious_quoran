#The Curious Quoran
==============

A cross-resource recommendation engine for Quora users, discovering hidden gems of interest on Coursera, Khan Academy, iTunes Podcast, LibGen and Project Gutenberg ebook repositories.


#### Motivation & Inspiration


For many of us, Quora is a beloved online repository of knowledge - a virtual meetingplace for hungry minds. True to its tagline, Quora often provides *"The best answer to any question."* Quora democratizes the knowledge, stories and intellectual resources of some of the most interesting and accomplished people in the world - public figures whose names you know (Jimmy Wales! Sheryl Sandberg!) but many others you may not.

My work is motivated by frequently asked Quora questions of the form: "*How / where can I learn more about ____*"; my goal is to augment the endogenous functionality of Quora's Stack Exchange-esque question and answer format by identifying latent user interests and recommending a curated set of resources among the following: Project Gutenberg ebook repository, Khan Academy lessons, Coursera courses and iTunes podcasts, thereby empowering autodidacts and curious individuals to continue their education free of charge.
