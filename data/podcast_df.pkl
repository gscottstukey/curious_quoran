(And\xc2\xa0he has a blowhole.) , For\xc2\xa0Robert\xe2\x80\x99s birthday we celebrate with some classic Krulwich and a peek into the spirit and sensibility that, in many ways, drives our show. , Today, a lady with a bird in her backyard upends our whole sense of what we may have to give up to keep a wild creature wild. , Today, the strange story of a small group of islands that raise a big question: is it inevitable that even our most sacred natural landscapes will eventually get swallowed up by humans? And just how far are we willing to go to stop that from happening? We are dedicating a whole hour to the Galapagos archipelago, the place that inspired Darwin\xe2\x80\x99s theory of evolution and natural selection. 179 years later, the Galapagos are undergoing rapid changes that continue to pose -- and possibly answer -- critical questions about the fragility and resilience of life on Earth. , Learn a new language faster than ever! Leave doubt in the dust! Be a better sniper!\xc2\xa0Could you do all that and more with just a zap to the noggin? Maybe. Sally Adee, an editor at New Scientist, was at a conference for DARPA - The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency - when she heard about a way to speed up learning with something\xc2\xa0called trans-cranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). A couple years later, Sally\xc2\xa0found herself\xc2\xa0weilding\xc2\xa0an M4 assualt rifle, picking off enemy combatants with a battery wired to her temple. Of course, it was a simulation,\xc2\xa0but Sally\'s sniper skills made\xc2\xa0producer Soren Wheeler wonder what we should think\xc2\xa0of the\xc2\xa0world of brain stimulation.\xc2\xa0 In the last couple years, tDCS has been all over the news. Researchers claim that juicing the brain with\xc2\xa0just 2 milliamps (think 9-volt battery) can help with everything from learning languages, to quitting smoking, to overcoming depression. We bring\xc2\xa0Michael Weisend, neuroscientist at Wright State Research Institute, into the studio to tell us how it works\xc2\xa0(Bonus: you get to hear Jad get his brain zapped). Peter Reiner and Nick Fitz of the University of British Columbia help us think through the consequences of a world where anyone with 20 dollars and access to Radioshack can make their own brain zapper. And finally, Sally tells us about the unexpected after-effects of a day of super-charged sniper training and makes us wonder about world where you can order up a state of mind. ,  A plum-sized lump of metal takes us from the French Revolution to an underground bunker in Maryland as we try to weigh the way we weigh the world around us. ,  This hour we investigate the objects around us, their power to move us, and whether it\'s better to look back or move on, hold on tight or just let go. ,  Today, the story of one little thing that has radically changed what we know about humanity\xe2\x80\x99s humble beginnings and the kinds of creatures that were out to get us way back when. Wits University Professor Lee Berger and Dr. Chris Stringer from London\xe2\x80\x99s Natural History Museum explain how a child\xe2\x80\x99s skull, found in an ancient cave, eventually helped answer one of our oldest questions: Where do we come from? Then Lee takes us on a journey to answer a somewhat smaller question: how did that child die? Along the way, we visit Dr. Bernhard Zipfel at Wits University in Johannesburg to actually hold the skull itself. We wanted to give you a chance to hold the skull, too. So we did a little experiment: we made a 3D scan of it. If you visit our page on Thingiverse, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see the results. Anyone with access to a 3D printer can print their own copy of the skull. (We printed a bunch, with help from our friends at MakerBot\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s even a purple one with sparkles.) We also collaborated with the folks at Mmuseumm, a tiny (really tiny, it\xe2\x80\x99s in an elevator shaft) museum in Manhattan. You can visit them to see the 3D printed skull, along with the other wonderful things in their collection: mosquitoes swatted mid-bite, toothpaste tubes from around the world, and much more. Thanks to JP Brown, Emily Graslie and Robert Martin at the Field Museum in Chicago for scanning the skull. Thanks to Curtis Schmitt and shootdigital for refining the scan. Thanks to Bre Pettis and Jenifer Howard at MakerBot for guiding us through the world of 3D printing. \xc2\xa0 ,  It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to think of anything more rational, more logical and impersonal than a number. But what if we\xe2\x80\x99re all, universally, also deeply attuned to how numbers \xe2\x80\xa6 feel? Why 2 is warm, 7 is strong and 11 is downright mystical. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 ,  How one sentence -- just 60 words written in the hours after the September 11 attacks -- became the legal foundation for the "war on terror." ,  From boom bap to EDM, we look at the line between hip-hop and not, and meet a defender of the genre that makes you question... who\'s in and who\'s out. ,  They buzz.

That\'s what we wanted to know. ,  From the stage to the cage, a series of showdowns that leave us wondering about the price of being right ... or coming from the left. ,  How a sunken nuclear submarine, a crazy billionaire, and a mechanical claw gave birth to a phrase that has hounded journalists and lawyers for 40 years and embodies the tension between the public\xe2\x80\x99s desire for transparency and the government\xe2\x80\x99s need to keep secrets. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 ,  You order some stuff on the Internet and it shows up three hours later. How could all the things that need to happen to make that happen happen so fast? \xc2\xa0 ,  This hour, we examine three very different kinds of black boxes\xe2\x80\x94those peculiar spaces where it\xe2\x80\x99s clear what\xe2\x80\x99s going in, we know what\xe2\x80\x99s coming out, but what happens in-between is a mystery. ,  At the start of this new year we crack open some fossils, peer back into ancient seas, and look up at lunar skies to find that a year is not quite as fixed as we thought it was. \xc2\xa0 , Jilted lovers and disrupted duck hunts provide a very odd look into the soul of the US Constitution. ,  In this new live stage performance, Radiolab turns its gaze to the topic of endings, both blazingly fast and agonizingly slow. ,  A preview of Radiolab\'s live show Apocalyptical: dinosaurs, death, destruction... plus cinematic live scoring and comedic mayhem from Reggie Watts and Kurt Braunohler.

In this short, we try to find out why.\xc2\xa0 ,  You may not give a second thought (or backward glance) to what the toilet whisks away after you do your business.

In this short, we head out to trace the trail of sludge...from Manhattan, to wherever poop leads us. ,  We\'ve all felt it, that irresistible urge to point the finger.

If you ask Ally Manning\'s mom and sister, they\'ll tell you there\'s no question: they\'re black. But as a teenager, Ally decided that what was true for them didn\'t make sense for her. ,  This fall, we\'re hitting the road with our brand-new live show.

And in 1961, when a car crash left him in a coma, these characters may have saved him. ,  John and Zoltan are both blind, but they deal with the world in completely different ways -- one paints vivid pictures in his mind, while the other refuses to picture anything at all.

aS'Developing Perspective is a podcast discussing the news of note in iOS Development, Apple and the like.  Hosted by David Smith, an independent iOS developer. Never longer than 15 minutes., I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a few folks ask me about my plans and ideas for Apple Watch.  While I don\xe2\x80\x99t try to be too coy about what I\xe2\x80\x99m working on I\xe2\x80\x99ve definitely kept some of my ideas close to the vest.  I\xe2\x80\x99m well aware that ideas, in general, are useless on their own.  But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that being promiscuous with your ideas is still always a good choice.Derek Sivers on ideas.Trying to formularize this I came up with the following structure for ideas and where sharing them is likely a good and poor choice.Like all good concepts it can be best demonstrated with a two-axis graph with four quadrants:On the one axis is the ease of implementing/realizing the idea.  On the other is the expected return on a successful implementation of that idea.Easy, High Reward: If you actually have one of these (you likely don\xe2\x80\x99t) keep it quiet and run with it as fast as you can.  Likely hyper competitive.  Simultaneous invention everywhere.Easy, Low Reward: Confections that are likely flash in the pan (if they flash at all).Hard, Low Reward: Time sinks, labors of love.  Most \xe2\x80\x98I have a great idea for an app\xe2\x80\x99 pitches. XKCD on easy vs hard problems.Hard, High Reward: Real businesses are built here., With the impending arrival of the AppleWatch next year and the WatchKit SDK next month I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to shift my focus towards \xe2\x80\x98wearables\xe2\x80\x99.  They present a few challenges to me as a developer, not the least of which is that I have almost no experience with that type of device.  I used to wear a watch years ago but haven\xe2\x80\x99t consistently for a long time.  I saw the Pebble when it first came out and it looked kinda janky.  But now it is clear this is an area that the larger companies that I piggyback my business on are heading so I\xe2\x80\x99m trying hard to make sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t fall off.To help me get up to speed I\xe2\x80\x99ve been purchasing a variety of devices to start getting my feet at least slightly damp, if not actually wet.  I started with the Jawbone UP and just got the Microsft Band.  These are my initial reactions and thoughts.Jawbone UP 24Microsoft Band, I recently hit a few milestones that got me thinking about the attributes of sustained projects.My 7th iOS (iPhone) Developer ProgramMy first app approved 6 years ago200 EpisodesI tried to boil them down into four keys:PurposeDiversityFlexibility / RuthlessnessPatience / Tenacity, Thinking through the Retina iMac in a world where pixels stop mattering.Also, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with the iPad?Marco Arments\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts on Retina iMac vs Mac ProAnandTech\xe2\x80\x99s Hands-on, While a single button might seem somewhat boring or mundane to discuss I unpack the process of thinking through a single button in Emoji++.

As a developer you have a variety of options available for how you approach it,  none of which are perfect.Trade Offs:App ReviewMarketing (good and bad)Bugs and IssuesHelpdesk loadNew features and their worthWasted effortApproaches:As ready as you\xe2\x80\x99ll ever be: Work feverishly, battling through buggy betas and API changes to be as possibly ready as possible for the estimated release date.Measured compatibility: Just make sure it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t breakKinda ready: Keep an eye on the changes, have plans in place for basic compatibility begin in earnest once bugs are fixedWait and See: Wait until you have all the information before you really start, With the rollout of iOS 8 upon us I consider two aspects of the current Apple ecosystem that appear to lie in tension.Pincer ManeuversApple is fantastic at laying groundwork.  When you take a step back and how their offerings both on software and hardware have evolved over the last few years you can clearly see how much forethought has gone into their approach.  Apple doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just throw things over the wall as soon as they are ready.  Instead they prefer to gradually expand and enhance their capabilities over time, giving developers lots of warning and time to adapt.I can think of many areas where this has been the case but perhaps the clearest example is the iPhone 6/6+ screens.  A few years back they brought Auto Layout to iOS.  Then they changed the UI aesthetic in iOS 7 to discourage designs that focused on pixel perfect layouts.  They introduced Dynamic Text to add an element of variability and customization to the user experience.  Then came Adaptive Layouts, Launch screen Nibs and Asset Collections. Each of these is a puzzle piece that gave the astute developer insight into what was coming down the road.  This is just one example.  Things like TouchID, or AirPlay have similar aspects.  You can even see some of this in the Apple Watch.  How it builds so neatly on top of the Extensions approach in iOS 8.You could almost imagine room deep in One Infinite Loop with a massive product roadmap laid out.  Around it, like Generals in combat, Craig and Jony push around the little pieces that comprise Apple\xe2\x80\x99s ecosystem. Slowly pushing them into place so that they can combine in clean pincer movements around desired objectives.Apple does this better than most companies I know.  There are times their plans don\xe2\x80\x99t quite come together but they do more often than not.  It is a reminder to me as a developer to try and not focus too tightly on the direct implications of a new API or technology.  Instead I should take a step back and think what this could be laying the groundwork for down the road.Stubbed ToesNobody likes stubbing their toes. It\xe2\x80\x99s painful, expletive laden and can leave a mark.  But what is really bad isn\xe2\x80\x99t stubbing your toe\xe2\x80\xa6it\xe2\x80\x99s stubbing your toe while running.  That is when the real damage happens.   Now it isn\xe2\x80\x99t just your toe that hurts it is your entire body hitting the pavement.The breakneck pace that Apple has been moving at over the last few years broken more than a few toes along the way.  I see this especially in the areas of Developer Tools and Infrastructure.  Working with these I\xe2\x80\x99m often give the impression that they are straining to the limit to keep up with the complexity and pace of the platforms they need to support.If an Army marches on its stomach, Developers march on their Tools.Xcode is the tool I spend most of my working life in.  I know it very well and for most of what I need it to do it does a great job.  But each year I am confronted with a new wave of challenges, crashes, or workarounds as I try to make it do what it ostensibly can and needs to do.  Some of these are excusable as early beta issues or components that weren\xe2\x80\x99t quite ready for WWDC but as we get close to launch their failings become painful.  If the tool isn\xe2\x80\x99t sharp the sculpture won\xe2\x80\x99t be smooth.Similarly the infrastructure that supports so much of what we need to do is straining to keep up.  Provisioning and iTunes Connect never quite seem finished.  Having done this for a long time I know most of the workaround and ways to massage things into place but I can only imagine how tricky this must be for a new developer.  They get better over time but just as soon as they stabilize some new complexity is thrown onto them to try and tackle.I have nothing but respect of the talented folks at Apple (some of which I know personally) who try and hold these together.  But it is Sisyphus-ian task to keep up with the pace of change in our toolset.  What worries me most is whether we are heading to a point where our pace of change will overtake their ability to keep up and then the whole body comes crashing down.In it together.These two aspects of modern iOS life are both closely entwined and diametrically opposed.  Apple appears to have an incredibly rich roadmap had for his platforms.  As a developer I can see tremendous opportunities coming down the pipe.  In many ways this is the best time to be a developer I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen.  I just hope that Apple is able to re-double their efforts on the tooling and infrastructure fronts to keep up with the colossal task ahead of them., Today I wanted to take a quick run through the App Review Guidelines.  Love \xe2\x80\x98em.  Hate \xe2\x80\x98em.  They are one of the most core parts of creating and distributing apps for the App Store.  I will give some high level thoughts about the state of App Review and then walk through some of the recent changes Apple published.I\xe2\x80\x99ll also touch on the new page Apple published listing the Common App Rejection reasons.I went ahead and organized the changes into a more readable format.Accessibility Note:  A less color oriented version of this diff is available here.PreambleWe have over a million Apps in the App Store.

Why we do them, how often we do them and whether they are important.ContextI did a long analysis of the update trends in the App Store.  I recommend you visit that yourself but the short version is:50% of Top Apps are have been updated in the last 3 months (26% overall)86% of Top Apps in the last year (60% overall)300,000 apps were updated in the last 3 months.480,000 apps are effectively abandoned (no updates in last year)Types of UpdatesAn actual shipped update might include more than one of the following categories but it is likely constructive to think about why you are making a change before you make it.Compatibility: An update that exists to allow the existing feature set to work on new hardware, operating system, API, etc.Remedial: An update that exists to correct a flaw or deficiency in existing functionality.Defensive: An update that exists to keep up with the competition.Enhancement: An update that adds functionality or capability to the app.Marketing: An update with purpose of drawing attention to the app or garnering revenue.Refactor: An update that does not change the user facing portions of the app but improves it internally.Things to considerIs this update necessary? Why, concretely, am I doing it?Does adding this functionality improve the app for most users?Would adding the functionality hurt the experience of any of my users?How do I expect to be compensated for the time I put into this update?, This past week has seen an explosion of writing and discussion about the business of making software for sale on the iOS App Store.  Personally I love it when these little bubbles of discussion appear.  If you\xe2\x80\x99ve listened to me for any period of time you\xe2\x80\x99ll know that one of the things I really like is being a student of the App Store.  These discussions provide the opportunity and motivation for all sorts of anecdotes which help expand my view on where things stand.I must confess I was a bit apprehensive in preparing for this week\xe2\x80\x99s show.  I have had a number of people reach out to me saying they can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to hear me chime in.  I\xe2\x80\x99m right in the thick of this.  I\xe2\x80\x99m an \xe2\x80\x9cindie\xe2\x80\x9d developer who has been making my living off the App Store for nearly five years now, so I\xe2\x80\x99m no stranger to the ups-and-downs it involves.   If you are hoping that I have some grand unified model that might summarize our current situation, sadly I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to disappoint.  Business is complicated, dynamic and ever changing.  You can do the same thing twice and have wildly different outcomes.  Replicating someone else\xe2\x80\x99s approach may not work, or may work shockingly better.  Perhaps most importantly, we all have different goals, personal situations and backgrounds.But here is my best effort, constructed as a series of semi-cohesive mini-rants.Super, mega, high level overview.It has never been easy to make a living (whatever that might mean to you) in the App Store.  When the Store was young it may have been somewhat more straightforward to try something and see if it would hit.  But it was never \xe2\x80\x9ceasy\xe2\x80\x9d.  Most of my failed apps were launched in the first 3 years of the Store.  As the Store has matured it has also become a much more efficient marketplace (in the economics sense of market).  The little tips and tricks that I used to be able to use to gain an \xe2\x80\x98unfair\xe2\x80\x99 advantage now are few and far between.  The fundamentals of business competition still apply:You need more than a good idea.The market doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care about the process it cares about the result.As supply goes up, prices will fall.Diversification of your product line is essential for stability.Most businesses will fail.\xe2\x80\xa6There are aspects of the App Store\xe2\x80\x99s design that may have enhanced or hastened the emergence of some of these behaviors (and certainly a few unnecessary, undesirable ones) but most would be there no matter what.Unique opportunity.One thing that also strikes me is how uniquely situated developers are as a profession.  It is rather remarkable that we can even consider there to be a reasonable likelihood that if we do the thing that we love it will ultimately result in a sustainable living.  I think of almost all other crafts where you can pursue your passion: art, design, acting, music, etc.  In most cases you either pursue your passion as a hobby and are fine with that or pursue it while employed by someone else.  Software and the current state of the tools at our disposal allow for a tremendous opportunity to have an alternative path.  For you to create something, to enjoy the process of making it and for it to be reasonably possible for you to make a living from it.  Let\xe2\x80\x99s be careful to make sure we don\xe2\x80\x99t forget just how fortunate a position that is.Different Goals.Whenever we start to think and talk in terms of things like \xe2\x80\x98making a living\xe2\x80\x99 it is almost necessarily ambiguous for what that might mean.  We all have different goals, lifestyles, standards of living.  Perhaps, even more significantly live in different countries.  Our individual definitions of success are likely wildly distinct.  I know many developers for whom the ultimate goal was simply to ship, and while the fleeting notion that they could derive some renumeration for their work was fun to muse about over a beer was never really the goal.  On the other hand I know people who dive in full steam and put their family livelihood on the back of their work.  I remember working on one of my apps in the early days of the App Store and reading an article by my most direct competitor (who I knew was making a similar amount of income as I because of our relative ranks).  He was based in eastern europe and talking about how he was able to support a team of developers on their income.  I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even yet able to support myself on that apps income.  It is all relative.I will again state my most oft stated advice to anyone wanting to get into making apps.  Define what success means for you, before you start building.Indie Life.The word \xe2\x80\x98Indie\xe2\x80\x99 has taken on a somewhat mythical connotation within our community (whether conscious  or unconsciously).  It can take on the persona of this genius engineer, tirelessly toiling away on their work, sweating the details, making the hard decisions and then (after much noble blood, sweat and tears) emerging with a gleaming product.  They then take this product out into the world and it begins to generate \xe2\x80\x9cpassive income\xe2\x80\x9d sufficient for them to continue their artisanal craftsmanship.  I must say I love this story.  It sure does sound nice.  It lets us elevate and aspire towards a rather delightful ideal.  However, as someone for whom this title is oft ascribed I can say the reality is almost nothing like this.Being an \xe2\x80\x98Indie\xe2\x80\x99 (if I take that definition to be a small 1-3 people] team of developers who make their core income directly from the software they create) is much less romantic. It is a lot of duct tape, cut corners, worried nights, ends-not-quite-meeting.  All with the Specter of Failure\xe2\x80\x99s chilled breath down your neck.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t get me wrong I love it, it appeals to my personality. But it isn\xe2\x80\x99t for everyone, nor should it be.As a community I think we tread into dangerous territory where we place undue elevation on this type of development and begin to (either directly or by implication) start to look down our proverbial noses at the many other much more sane ways to make a living. I have tremendous respect for people who support their families working hard within larger corporations (whether that be Apple or the OmniGroup or XYZ Corp).  And for consultants who do the very hard work of consulting.The nobility comes intrinsically from the effort, from the care and attention, from work in its own right.  It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come from the context in which that work is done, it is the work itself.Patience.There is a natural human reflex to look at the end result of someone\xe2\x80\x99s long effort and want to arrive at the same endpoint, but without internalizing the time, energy and effort it took to get there.  If you are foolish enough to begin down the path of creating and selling your own products the single most important thing to have as a character trait is patience, well maybe that and a thick skin.  The path to a sustainable income is almost necessarily built upon a series of mistakes (whether they be public or private).  I can think of very few counter examples to the notion that it will takes a time period measured in years to be able to support yourself from your work.  I do truly believe that building quality products, being an adaptive student of the stores/markets into which they are sold and consistently improving your own skills provides a likely path to sustainable revenue, but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t an easy, nor quick path.Build. Ship. Repeat.Required Reading.Here are a selection of the fantastic posts written on this topic recently.  I commend them all to you as homework.  If you have any interest in devoting your time or career into this arena you\xe2\x80\x99ll be foolish to not put in the time to read them all.  They are written by some seriously smart people, who I respect very much.Confessions of an ex-developerWho at the Table is an Indie iOS Developer? - Brent SimmonsA Candid Look at Unread\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s First Year - Jared SinclairMore on iOS Indies - Brent SimmonsJared Sinclair Discusses Unread\xe2\x80\x99s Earnings - Benjamin MayoThe New Indie - Cezar PereiraA Candid Look at the Financial Side of Building Mac Apps on Your Own - Tyler HallApp Rot - Marco ArmentLooking Up - Joe CieplinskiUnavoidable - Luc VandalThe Price of Great Software- Robert MyersWhy I Left Indie Development - Nick BradburyBeing Indie in 2014 - Gus MuellerHacker News on Jared\xe2\x80\x99s ArticleOn Promotion and Marketing - A Response to Critics of Yesterday\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s Article about Unread - Jared SinclairThe market for paid apps, and the sum of all compromises - Rene RitchieApp Store Pricing Models - Stephen JohnsonDevelopers cannot monetize continuous development of their products. - amberThe iOS Indie That Could - Faruk Ate\xc3\x85\xc2\x9f, Back from a delightful, extended vacation I want to take a minute (or 15) to talk about the importance of stepping back from the day to day inputs that can so easily mold or distort your views on things.  The world is a varied and complex place and likely very different than the people and perspectives you interact with on a daily basis., I will be on vacation for the next two weeks, so unless something monumental happens in between now and late July there won\xe2\x80\x99t be any episodes of Developing Perspective.Back at WWDC, basking in the glow of the river of great new announcements I had quipped \xe2\x80\x9cWow, they gave us everything but a business model.\xe2\x80\x9d  That comment is clearly absurd but it does drive towards a more honest and worthwhile point.  In many ways the situation iOS developers find themselves in heading into the Autumn of 2014 isn\xe2\x80\x99t about technology or tools, it is about business.  As the market has matured the natural consequence is that older inefficiencies that may have propped up unsustainable models have fallen away.The App Store and related ecosystems are now extremely efficient.  If there is an opportunity to be exploited we can expect it to be found and exploited.  If you come up with a great new idea it will be analyzed, dissected and the interesting parts copied with often head-turning pace.  As I have navigated this transition myself I have started to see many issues with the approach I had been taking to my business.  Some of which I have been able to address but many of which I\xe2\x80\x99m still working through.For the purpose of today\xe2\x80\x99s episode I thought it might be constructive to take a quick tour of the various models and their various strengths and weaknesses.  I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be working in rough order of which I think they are desirable in the current ecosystem.Subscriptionstl;dr - People pay you on an ongoing basis for providing software and software related services.Pros - So long as your subscription base is enough for your expenses and your renewal/signup rate exceeds your cancellations you are golden.Cons - Often tricker to get someone to make a long term commitment. Managing credit cards, expirations, etc.  Typically smaller user base needed (yay!), each requiring and feeling owed more (not so yay).Advertisingtl;dr - People use your software and are presented a message from someone else you pays you.Pros - Strong possibility for ongoing revenue.  Can make your software free.Cons - You need to show other people\xe2\x80\x99s messages in your apps.  Requires large customerbases for reasonable revenue.Consumable In-App Purchasestl;dr - People make (typically) small, repeated payments to continue to gain access to aspects of your software.  Gratuity based models also fall into this category.Pros - Strong possibility for ongoing revenue.  Lets you segment your customer base by how much they are willing to spend.Cons - Can quickly get very dodgy.One Time In-App Purchasestl;dr - People make payments to gain access to specific parts of the application or content therein.Pros - Gives users a clear trial of the experience before needing to make a commitment.Cons - Often very tricky to work out what part of the application can be segmented off.  If you are too generous nobody will buy, too stingy and nobody will buy.Up Front One Time Purchasetl;dr - People pay money to be able to use your software.Pros - Simple and straightforward.Cons - Trickier to make sustainable since your effectively cap your income per user. Single Price. Long term support gets hard to justify.Freetl;dr - You create software, everyone uses it without charge.Pros - Wide adoption potential.Cons - Often hard to sustain long term.  Most often seen in either altruistic or venture based software.What is best?It is going to vary for each business.  What I have found over the last 6 years is that models that have more of a focus on ongoing revenue are more sustainable than things that are more one-time oriented.  Mixing as many as you can often is important too.It is also absolutely imperative that you have a good working definition of what success looks like for yourself before you can make a thoughtful choice., This past week we had a bit of drama about the role of podcast networks.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t intend to wade into that discussion but as a result of it I was asked about the role that linking and recommendations play in expanding my own audience for this show. Which is considerable and measurable. I wanted to return the favor this week by talking about how I stay informed about the goings-on in Apple development.This isn\xe2\x80\x99t an exhaustive list but these are the places I always make sure I\xe2\x80\x99m up to date with.I actually use Twitter a lot less than I used to.

So be careful how much you bite off. (It was Sept 10 for iOS 7).Try to focus on what is going to cool in iOS 8, tackling lots of problems that aren\xe2\x80\x99t specific to it might not make much sense.And most of all, have fun!, My initial impressions on the 2014 WWDC Keynote.  Wow, it was a big one., This year I\xe2\x80\x99m going to skip my usual soapbox speech about WWDC tips and etiquette.  Given the way the ticket distribution played out it seems neither kind nor productive.  If you are going to WWDC I commend these two#128: WWDC Tips and Etiquette.#53: Please, be polite at WWDC.Today I\xe2\x80\x99m going to talk through a bit of my thoughts heading into WWDC.  If the last episode bummed you out a bit this will hopefully put a more positive spin onto things.I also talk a bit about what I\xe2\x80\x99m expecting/hoping to see announced next week.I will be in San Francisco next week and hope you meet many of you there., I wax philosophical about the future.  Trying to wrestle with the uncertainty that surrounds our industry.  Some products succeed, some products fail.  Where will mine fall?, My thanks to everyone who purchased a t-shirt in the last two weeks.  They should be at the printer and then on their way to your door within the next week or so.Anxiety and InertiaI\xe2\x80\x99ll be taking a quick break from the Unconventional Wisdom series today.  I want to ruminate a bit on something more topical for my personally.Feed Wrangler hit its one year anniversary this past week.  That accomplishment in and of itself is rather significant for me.  If you have been listening to this podcast over the last year you know the trials and triumphs getting to here has involved.  I wrote up my thoughts about that here if you are interested.The actual topic I want to discuss though isn\xe2\x80\x99t directly related to Feed Wrangler.  It has to do with the anxiety of sustaining a business.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve been making my primary living from the App Store for just shy of five years now.  In that time I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it morph and change dramatically.  The manner in which I have been able to make a living has necessarily required several adjustments along the way.  One thing that has remained constant is the lurking sense of anxiety that tomorrow everything will fall apart and my business will fail. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had that lingering fear now for five years running.  From talking to other iOS developers I know I\xe2\x80\x99m not alone in it.As a brief aside the funny thing about being independent is that this anxiety feels much more real than it does working for a larger company but I doubt if it is actually as dramatically more likely as it feels.  Because there is a direct connection between your work and your success everything gets magnified.  But I suspect you are roughly as likely to get laid off as you are for your business to fail.I\xe2\x80\x99ve had to learn to deal with this fear in order to stay sane and to take the risks necessary to grow my business.  It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gone away but it has become manageable, if not useful, for me.The key I found was to rely on what I will now pompously refer to as \xe2\x80\x9cUnderscore\xe2\x80\x99s First Law of Business Dynamics\xe2\x80\x9dOn any given timeframe, the rate your business will decay roughly matches the rate it grew.Put another way fast up, fast down \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 slow up, slow down.I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this in my own apps time and time again.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll have big spikes followed by big falls, but over the long term things decay much more slowly.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve rarely been hit by sudden dramatic fall offs in sales unless they were preceded by big spikes.  They haven\xe2\x80\x99t always been at the level I\xe2\x80\x99d like but even when an app falls down to just a few sales a day\xe2\x80\xa6it tends to stay consistent there.This gives me some comfort.  When I look at my business today I can roughly predict how it will do by looking at the past few months.  The trends over the long term might not always work out but the need for day to day worry is likely unfounded., T-shirtsI am doing another run of t-shirts for the show.  After I did the campaign for them last fall I heard from a lot of people that they missed out.  This year I\xe2\x80\x99m giving the campaign a nice long run (through April 28). The shirt design this year combines three distinctly geeky things\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94underscores, square brackets and fixed width fonts.Shirts are $14.59 (never longer than 15 minutes).

My thanks for the dozens of people who have already got one.Unconventional WisdomI\xe2\x80\x99m doing a series of episodes trying to take contrarian positions against conventional wisdom in software development.  My goal is to challenge the assumptions we make and help us to think more critically about how we conduct our business.The result is something that isn\xe2\x80\x99t 100% my actual position on things but should be productive and hopefully thought provoking nevertheless.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll be making sweeping, un-nuanced statements for effect.  As with everything in life, it is more complicated than I\xe2\x80\x99m going to present it.  The interesting part of being in business is navigating that nuance for yourself.The second topic is customer support.Providing good customer support is important?I can\xe2\x80\x99t count the number of times I have heard \xe2\x80\x9cthe thing we pride ourselves in is our customer support\xe2\x80\x9d at conferences.  I have so often heard people getting up and talking about how they love interacting with their customers.  How this has driven their companies forward.  How it is the responsible thing to do as a software engineer.  I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t disagree more.The needs of the manyTo start off my attack on the important of good customer support I\xe2\x80\x99m going to start off by invoking Spock\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94which should likely settle the matter.  The needs of the many out weigh the needs of the few.  That in a nutshell is the core of the problem with providing good customer support.  Every business (except perhaps VC based shops) are always operating in an environment of scarcity.  You are forced to make hard decisions about how you spend your time and money. Within that context any time and energy that you are putting into customer support is necessarily taking time away from energy that you could be putting into making your product better.  Helping customers individually is terribly inefficient.  Hopefully your product has a large enough audience that any one person is a vanishingly small percentage of your overall customer base.  Would you rather spend a few hours definitely making 99.99999% of your customer\xe2\x80\x99s experience better or making it possibly better for the 0.00001%?Relentlessly focusing on making the product better and better also has the effect of reducing the need for one-on-one customer support.Horrible, unscalable hourly rateIf your product is available in the iOS app store the revenue you receive per customer is likely pretty small.  You are likely getting somewhere between $0.70 and $2.10 per user (at best).  If you spend 15 minutes helping a customer out you are looking at an hourly rate of $2.80 - $8.40/hr.  You\xe2\x80\x99d be better off burning coffee and mispronouncing names at Starbucks.  Also, how can you scale up your product with that type of cost.  If you want to provide customer support for increasingly more and more customers you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to hire someone to help.  You are then either paying them minimum wage or taking a loss with each request.Worst customersNot to pass a judgment on the actual people using your software but the people who require your support are also necessarily your worst customers.  The best customers for your business are ones who give you money then cost you the least.  These are the customers you want.   You want to make life as good for these people as possible.  They are going to be the reason your business is able to be sustainable.  To apply the 80/20 rule you want to optimize and focus on the experience of the productive 80%, not the counter productive 20%.You don\xe2\x80\x99t need itI\xe2\x80\x99m often struck by how most of the wildly successful apps in the App Store provide no customer support whatsoever.  I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of games.  You hardly ever see a game with a \xe2\x80\x98Contact Us\xe2\x80\x99 button in it.  They just build a solid app, deploy it to the market and then reap the benefits of their labors.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut productivity software is different,\xe2\x80\x9d you say.  Is it, or are we just lazily relying on customer support to fill in the holes we allow to grow in our products?  In many ways the need to provide customer support is a symptom of a problem in our products. The need to provide extensive support or help to our customers necessarily means we have missed something in our development process.  Maybe we should just put more effort in getting it right the first time., T-shirtsI am doing another run of t-shirts for the show.

Get one at http://teespring.com/developing .Wrapping upI have published the consolidated, summarized article for my Towards a Better App Store series.Unconventional WisdomToday I thought it might be fun to start another series of episodes.  I like doing series because then I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to think so much about my topic each week.  The concept I\xe2\x80\x99m starting with is modeled a bit after debate exercise where you are given a topic or statement then told to take either the pro or against position.  The process of having to defend either side of an argument often helps to think in ways you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t otherwise.  Along those lines I\xe2\x80\x99m going to try and take the intentionally contrarian position against \xe2\x80\x98conventional wisdom\xe2\x80\x99 in the software business.The result is something that isn\xe2\x80\x99t 100% my actual position on things but should be productive and hopefully thought provoking nevertheless.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll be making sweeping, un-nuanced statements for effect.  As with everything in life, it is more complicated than I\xe2\x80\x99m going to present it.  The interesting part of being in business is navigating that nuance for yourself.The first topic I\xe2\x80\x99m going to attack is pricing.Paid software is good for customers and developers?When I first got into the software business nearly 6 years ago the prevailing \xe2\x80\x98best practice\xe2\x80\x99 for software sales was to charge a reasonable up front price for your product.  Then provide minor update and bug-fix update patches for free.  Then charge (with upgrade pricing) for each major update to the product.  This model had worked pretty well for many years and had grown up in the era of boxed software.  More importantly this system had been widely accepted by customers as reasonable and appropriate.It is, however, an awful way to sell software.  For, at least, 3 reason.Barrier to entrySoftware typically has an extremely low marginal cost.  Unless you are hosting media for your customers you can typically add one more customer to your user-base for a tiny cost.  Even with things like customer support you each additional user is essentially free. As such charging a large up front amount for your software doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense.  This pricing model could only be maintained in an uncompetitive marketplace.  Otherwise, you will quickly be undercut by someone else who is willing to lower their prices, to get them closer to their marginal costs.You are also scaring away potential customers.  Often the hardest part of selling software is getting it known to potential customers.  If you finally have a customer considering your product (after whatever long, drawn out marketing effort) and then you put up a barrier to them then actually getting it you are shooting yourself in the foot.  That is likely your only chance to convince them to download it, make that process as easy as possible.UnsustainableThe paid software model is fundamentally unsustainable.  To most clearly demonstrate this imagine a world where your paid sales are going well, you\xe2\x80\x99ve built up a reasonable customer-base of happy users and then suddenly your sales drop off.  The reason for the drop off isn\xe2\x80\x99t particularly important.  You now find yourself in an extremely awkward position.  You continue to have expenses and have made commitments for minor updates to your customers but have no income to back them up.  You either need to start squeezing your existing users progressively harder for additional income or go out of business.The fundamental flaw in this model was that each purchase was necessarily short-lived.  You had no plan to make a continuous income from your product.  Each day you need to find more people to buy your software.  A process that will be progressively harder and more expensive to do.  You\xe2\x80\x99ve spent all the good-will of your customers all once.Imagine instead a business model that is based on subscriptions or advertising.  This is far better.  Now your viability as a business is directly based on how used your software actually is!  Should your application fall out of favor and your customers stop using it, then fine, your income drops but nobody has any commitments that you are then not following through on if you cease development.  If it is wildly successful then you have a virtuous cycle of more revenue for more development.Horribly AbruptThe nature of the paid model is to get large bundles of income along with significant updates.  Your sales will often then fall down dramatically thereafter.  This means that you are essentially in a feast-and-famine cycle.  You need to store up and be frugal enough with the days of plenty to survive through the days of want.  I can say from experience this is horrifically stressful.  As you chip away at your storehouse your level of comfort will dramatically reduce. While conceptually you could say that it is functionally identical to getting the same overall amount evenly over the same period, human nature says otherwise.  There are few things as comforting as a dependable, consistent income.  Something paid apps simply don\xe2\x80\x99t provide., I hope you fared better in the WWDC lottery than I did, though I\xe2\x80\x99m hopeful for a possibility of a second round on Monday (maybe?).  The system and process generally went really well and I think this is likely the process we\xe2\x80\x99ll see going forward.  It isn\xe2\x80\x99t perfect but is as good as I could imagine.Improving the App Store: Part 5RatingsThe star rating of an application is the most important aspects of the sale experience that is outside of the developer\xe2\x80\x99s direct control.  It is displayed on every page and instance where your app is shown and gives the customer a general cue about the quality of your app.  As such developers tend to take whatever actions they can to increase it.  If this were just a question of improving the quality of their apps that would be fine but that isn\xe2\x80\x99t where most developers stop off. Not to reopen the tempest about prompt dialogs, but there are a lot of potentially dubious and tricky things developers can do to try and \xe2\x80\x98artificially\xe2\x80\x99 boost their ratings.  There are also some really solid, thoughtful ways to accomplish the same goal.My general recommendations about ways this could be improved.Define a clear policy about where, how, and when applications may prompt for reviews.Much of the discussion around the dialog prompts stemmed from a feeling that \xe2\x80\x98everyone was doing it\xe2\x80\x99 so \xe2\x80\x98I need to too\xe2\x80\x99.  The best way to reward earnest developers who are trying to optimize for their users\xe2\x80\x99 experience is to level the playing field by establishing exactly what is permitted.Make the rating scale a rolling, weighted average rather than just current, at least soon after updates.I remember when Apple changed the review score from a global average to only the current version.  This was an attempt to make sure that a single buggy version didn\xe2\x80\x99t forever hang around your neck.  It also makes the reviews perhaps more reflective of the experience the customer should expect.  The challenge though is that immediately after submitting your update your reviews all go to zero which gives the customer a very different perspective about your app.  It makes it look unused or low quality.  This discourages updates and encourages annoying your users with review prompts immediately after updates.  Either show the overall average or a rolling, weighted average, even if only recently after update.EditorialWhile the role and scope of editorial (feature) coverage of the store has been steadily improving over the years I think there is still a massive amount of room to be done here.  Apart from the top lists, the featured area is probably the most visible place your app can be found.  Building an app with the goal of being featured incentivizes quality, thoughtful and relevant app creation.  Which is great but means that the value of being featured should be less abrupt.Expand the scope and frequency of editorial coverage in the StoreIt seems very odd that features are only ever updated once a week (typically thursday afternoon).  New apps are added to the store constantly, updates are submitted constantly, it seems like features should be updated accordingly.  I\xe2\x80\x99d love to see things like \xe2\x80\x98daily picks\xe2\x80\x99/promotions or similar.  Things that could potentially drive user engagement with the App Store app, checking in on what is new and interesting.Make an app\xe2\x80\x99s featured status visible after their initial featureIf an app is featured I\xe2\x80\x99d love to see some kind of badge or notation on its App Store page promoting its selection.  Apple has already taken the time and effort to identify apps that are worth the user\xe2\x80\x99s attention, why not communicate that to user\xe2\x80\x99s on the actual product page for the app.  Similarly I\xe2\x80\x99d love to see the curated lists that Apple puts together show up as search results.  For example, if you search for \xe2\x80\x98accounting\xe2\x80\x99 the featured list for \xe2\x80\x9cManaging your Money\xe2\x80\x9d would seem like a great place to present the user with some apps that might be worth initially considering.  This has the added benefit of improving the quality of search results.CategoriesExpand the diversity of categories associated with each app.Lastly I\xe2\x80\x99d love to see the variety and specificity of categories you could assign to an app be expanded. The current metadata assignment into one of only 24 categories seems paltry when trying to catalog over a million individual apps.  I\xe2\x80\x99m sure based on the search data that Apple has at its disposal I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they could subdivide of the existing categories into several useful sub-categories (much like how games are treated).  This would also help improve the relevance of the top charts.  Being the top app in a more niche sub-category might be genuinely useful for developers and customers alike.This concludes this series on the App Store., A few words of appreciation for the new lottery based WWDC ticket sales.  Get your name in the hat by Monday morning.Then I talk through some of the tradeoffs involved in choosing the level of abstraction to use for your web-service backends, explaining my own tendency to go pretty low level.  Starting from these few posts:The Parts of Your PlatformWeb Hosting For App DevelopersOn Running Your Own Servers, and Why We\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99re Not, After taking credit ;) for Apple\xe2\x80\x99s experiments in search improvements I dive into a few changes to the App Store that could improve doing business in the store.Make the App Store Refund policy more obviousI really don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why Apple makes the refund process so opaque and awkward.  I know from my own experience in physical stores that a clear and easy refund policy helps drive sales.  It is far better than a \xe2\x80\x98trial-mode\xe2\x80\x99 because it sustains the value of the app (rather than giving it away for free then asking for money later).  However, it still maintains that escape hatch for purchases unsure of whether they really want the app.I\xe2\x80\x99d love two things, neither of which are actually policy changes.Educate App Store customers about what the policy is and ideally phrase it in clear terms.I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there is an internal policy within Apple customer support, but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to find a clear explanation of it.  The legalese Terms and Conditions for the App Store states that \xe2\x80\x9cAll sales and rentals of products are final\xe2\x80\x9d but that is clearly not the actual policy since people get refunds all the time.  Whatever the policy is this should be clear the customers.Make the process of applying for a refund clear and straightforward.Right now you go to reportaproblem.apple.com and then fill in a form.  I\xe2\x80\x99d love to see this integrated into the App Store app itself.  Perhaps even into the Purchased Apps area.Make in-app purchases (especially consumable) more honestBuilding on a blog post I wrote last year I would love to see the App Store better inform its customers about how in-app purchases will affect their experience of an app.Present a typical overall cost for an app in the App Store descriptionMake it clear that when you are downloading an app that says \xe2\x80\x98free\xe2\x80\x99 next to it that you may not actually be making the less expensive choice.  Also, provides a clear expectation about the type of app the user is about to interact with.Show how much you have spent on the app with each new purchase.Be upfront with the user about how much money they have spent.  Allowing them to make a more informed (and less manipulated) decision.Drop or reframe the Top Grossing ChartThe Top Grossing chart was ostensibly added to help improve the visibility of higher paid apps within the store, at least that is how it appeared to me externally.  If that is the goal it entirely fails to do that.  Either drop the list or perhaps change it to only include paid apps, or at least exclude consumable in-app purchases from the \xe2\x80\x98app revenue\xe2\x80\x99 number., I will be at NSConference next week, if you are a listener of the show please make sure you find me and say hi.Continuing my series of Towards a Better App Store, trying to find practical suggestions for how we could improve the App Store.  Today I\xe2\x80\x99m going to focus on Search.Physical Design: Make the cards interface for search optional (if not eliminated).Ranking: Rewards or punish applications based on objective measures.  For example, recently updated, crash frequency, refund requests, reviews, etc.Curation: While still algorithmically based periodically vet the most popular keywords to ensure good relevance.Power Search: Add the ability to filter and manage search results to more finely tune the results., Towards a Better App Store: Part 2Make it up in VolumeThis is Part 2 of an ongoing series trying to explore practical ways that the App Store could be better for customers.  Today I\xe2\x80\x99m going to talk about the Store\xe2\x80\x99s size.The size of the App Store\xe2\x80\x99s catalog is often thrown around as a valuable, useful metric for judging the heath and vitality of the ecosystem.  That may have been true before a certain scale.  There is value in having a diverse and deep inventory that mets every need but beyond a certain point it completely looses relevance.  Duplication, \xe2\x80\x98spamming\xe2\x80\x99 and decay of older apps hurts the store more than helps it.  In many ways the incredible volume of the Store is at the core of many of the other challenges it faces.  App Review takes longer than developers would like.  Search becomes tricky.  Editorially curating new arrivals becomes daunting.It isn\xe2\x80\x99t an easy problem to solve.  How do you determine which apps should be allowed in which should not.  Just how many Flappy clones should be allowed to exist in the Store?  5, 10, 1000?  It isn\xe2\x80\x99t just the overall size that is a problem though, the rate of increase is also increasing.This is only new apps approved on the store (taken from 148Apps), add to this updates and it is an incredible volume.Also, how many of the apps on the App Store are being actively maintained.  I\xe2\x80\x99d guess the number is pretty low but the old apps still stay there.  Buoying the numbers but not actually providing good value toAside on AppleFor this whole series I\xe2\x80\x99m going to assume that tackling the questions of making the App Store better aren\xe2\x80\x99t constrained by budget nor desire.  I\xe2\x80\x99m going to assume that somewhere in Apple\xe2\x80\x99s Profit &amp; Loss they can find whatever resources they need to attack these challenges.  Furthermore, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to assume that they have a desire to make the App Store as customer friendly a place as possible.  Both of these seem like reasonable things to assume but I feel I should put that out there before I begin.RecommendationsI had initially gone down the road of trying to work out ways to make judgments about which apps are the \xe2\x80\x98good\xe2\x80\x99 ones and which \xe2\x80\x98deserved\xe2\x80\x99 to be in the Store.  It very quickly became clear that this was nearly impossible to do.  While I (personally) can look at apps on the store and say they don\xe2\x80\x99t belong, based on my own tastes.  This never generalized.  The App Store would be worse off if it were filtered with too harsh an opinion.  I had also thought of applying other external limits on the number of apps.  Things like raising the cost per submission or number of new apps per developer per year.  These would only really affect the current trend of re-skinned apps (which can be better addressed directly), I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have things simple for the majority than punish everyone for a few bad apples.I\xe2\x80\x99m reminded of a parenting adage.  Have few rules but strictly enforce them.  I think this would do much to improve the situation on the Store.  The App Review Guidelines are a pretty solid set of rules.  They have evolved and adapted to the times but overall they do a pretty good job of keeping out the stuff that is objectively \xe2\x80\x98junk\xe2\x80\x99.  There are of course grey areas, as there should be, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have too many complaints with the guidelines we have today.  The area that I think we could do much better on is the way in which they are enforced.  Specifically, when they are enforced.  As best I can tell, other than in exceptional cases once an app is approved it is always approved.#1: Apps should be required to pass approval on an ongoing basis.The purpose of the having app review and rules about what constitutes an acceptable app is to form and direct the content of the store in the customer\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  This applies to things like avoiding crashing, malware ridden software.  It equally applies to establishing a baseline of design and development standards that everyone must meet.  Having things like the Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) as a requirement for submissions establishes a bare minimum for quality for all apps.  However, the App Store is a vibrant, ever moving ecosystem.  What was acceptable a few years ago is likely not today, at least not without any adaptations.  This applies most concretely to supporting new versions of iOS.  Since February 1st all new submissions just be built against the latest SDK and be \xe2\x80\x9coptimized for iOS 7\xe2\x80\x9d.  If that applies on the front end, it should be reapplied to the back-catalog as well.Exactly how this would be applied doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter. It could be applied on a monthly, quarterly or (honestly) even annual basis.  The important thing is that it would create a Store where any app a customer purchases would be assured of meeting and complying with the current set of guidelines.  The stated goal of the Guidelines is to \xe2\x80\x9censure they are reliable, perform as expected, and are free of offensive material.\xe2\x80\x9d  I believe every app on the store should meet those criteria.If older apps no longer meet the stated guidelines for what an app should be they should be de-listed (still available to re-download if already purchased).  Leaving space on the virtual shelves for apps that provide the best possible experience for customers.  This would constitute a lot of work for the App Review team, but I think it is hard to argue that the result wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be worth it for customers., This begins a multi-part series on how I think we could move the App Store forward.  I had initially thought this could be a single show but quickly realized that it will take quite a few 15 minute conversations to really unpack what can practically be done to make the App Store a better place.A note on Show Notes.  I\xe2\x80\x99m planning to continue the long form notes for now, but realize that they are only a taste of what is discussed in the show and not a transcript.The GoalIt is perhaps a bit glib to assume that the App Store is in need of fixing.  It is perhaps the most success software marketplace in history.  It has facilitated the download of over 60 billion applications.  It removed a tremendous amount of friction and hassle with software distribution.  It has allowed the creation of a new way for customers to think about software.But I think it can be better.  I have genuine, personal affection for the App Store.  It has allowed me personally to do things I never thought possible.  But (to quote myself):I want to believe that the App Store is a special place. I want for it to be the singularly best venue for customers to come and find innovative, well designed, quality software. Software that pushes the boundaries of what is possible and continually amazes and delights its customers. I want for there to be an aspirational pull upwards on my own development. I want to feel like I need to work extra hard to make sure my apps meet the high standards my customers have been trained to expect.I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the App Store lives up to these projected goals, but I think it could.When trying to think of the areas and ways in which the App Store could be improved it is likely not productive to think from a developer\xe2\x80\x99s point of view.  In all cases for the App Store to be successful it needs to be customer oriented.  I need a target towards which to aim.  With this in mind I started out with the goal making an app store that:Helps customers find quality apps to fill their current need as quickly as possible.That need could be specific (I need to listen to a podcast) or general (I\xe2\x80\x99m bored, What fun apps have come out recently).  In either case the goal of the App Store should be to help customers find a robust, quality app in as few taps as possible.  Stated in the converse it would minimize customer confusion, disappointment and regret.Generally speaking this will also help out developers.  Many discussions of what would make the App Store better tend to focus around a theoretical divide between \xe2\x80\x9cGood\xe2\x80\x9d developers and \xe2\x80\x9cBad\xe2\x80\x9d developers.  I know I myself have fallen into this stereotyping, but it is unlikely to be productive when considering a broader context.  There are some behaviors that we can likely all agree are undesirable (copyright infringement, deceptive marketing, etc) but beyond that it is constructive to start with an assumption that all apps enter the store equal and are differentiated based on the market itself not our own notions.The ProblemsOver the next few weeks I plan to unpack ways this could improve in the following areas:Catalog SizeBusiness ModelsSearchRatingsEditorialCategoriesTop Charts, There is something tragic about the Flappy Bird saga.  The events and realities of it aren\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily anything new but they showcase some of the darker sides of our industry.The HateThings like Twitter and the short attention span culture that grows up around it have developed a mentality where it seems perfectly acceptable to tear apart other people or their work.  Over the weekend I was disheartened to see so many people I know and admire passing judgement on someone they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know based on 140 character messages.  Guessing the motives of anyone other than your closest friends is a fools errand, and even for them it is usually a terrible idea (just ask my friends).  People are complicated, fragile and valuable.  Projecting into someone else\xe2\x80\x99s situation and then passing degrees on how they respond isn\xe2\x80\x99t nearly as productive as projecting yourself into their situation and trying to learn for yourself.Words have meaning and I see no clearer example of how powerful they can be than what happened to Dong Nguyen.  I genuinely hope he is able to move on from this in a positive way.Jeff Vogel\xe2\x80\x99s take on this is worth a read.  He comes from a background where he has had to deal with this type of interaction.  While he has a variety of good points I found his observations about the role PR companies play in business very germane to this audience.  The blessing and curse of being an independent is that you often interact directly with your customers.  It is impossible for this to not impact you personally and emotionally.  Human nature is to dwell on the negative far more than the positive.  If you aren\xe2\x80\x99t careful about drawing boundaries you\xe2\x80\x99ll go crazy.A lessonThere are a number of more squishy lessons to learn from Flappy Bird, but there is one that is manifestly practical.  Never, ever, ever share revenue numbers publicly.  As soon as you throw a number out there it will be all anyone can talk about.  This is a natural reaction since it is one of the only things about your unique situation that is directly comparable to theirs.  That voyeuristic tendency is highly venomous.   Every single article I\xe2\x80\x99ve read since has thrown that number around as a core part of their justifications.  Just don\xe2\x80\x99t do it.  While I know it can be frustrating to see y-axis without numbers or to want to learn from the experiences of others it is never a great idea, and this coming from someone who tries very hard to share my numbers, stats and results.Localization ResultsI published a breakdown of the impact of localizing Pedometer++.  Overall it was a great success.A  requestI\xe2\x80\x99ve never really asked for iTunes reviews, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t something I think is particularly important nor something I like doing.  However, the quantitative side of me really wonders if it is as important as various podcast hosts say.  So I\xe2\x80\x99d like to conduct a little experiment.  If you have time over the next week I\xe2\x80\x99d love for you to write or rate the show in iTunes.  You can find it here.  I\xe2\x80\x99m skeptical but very curious about what an influx of reviews would do.  Thank you., I\xe2\x80\x99m trying a new format for show notes.  This is half blog post, half podcast.  Let me know what you think.I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to wade into the specifics of the Paper-on-Paper-on-Paper-on-Paper battle but I thought it was an interesting topic to address more generally.  Naming is an important part of creating, launching and marketing a product.  Along with your icon it is probably the single most significant part of your branding efforts.  It is what people will search for and how they will tell others about your app.  Here are some of the things I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned from my tenure in the App Store.Remember folks, I\xe2\x80\x99m not a lawyer.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t base your legal or branding choices solely on the recommendation of a 15 minute podcast.Considerations when choosing a nameThere are two general groups that your app\xe2\x80\x99s name can fall into:A unique, contrived or invented word.  Some examples of this category are Groupon, YouTube, Snapchat and Pinterest.  The advantage of these is that they are typically easier to defend and protect.  Because you made up a word it is hard for people to claim collisions are coincidence.A more generic term.  Some examples of this category are Audiobooks, Paper, Flashlight and Camera. The advantage of these is that they are easily recognizable and have built in search optimization.  However, they are much trickier to defend and lay claim to.Some App Store RealitiesName \xe2\x80\x9csquatting\xe2\x80\x9d is a reality of the Store. While Apple has a variety of policies in place to attempt to mitigate this it is easy for someone to lay claim to a name in the Store without really using it to sell an actual product.As of today there have been 1,509,669 apps approved in the life of the App Store. With that large of a pool it is very likely that all the basic, short names have already been used for most common nouns and verbs (The Oxford English Dictionary only has around 250,000 words for comparison).Name duplication is possible through a variety of means.  I used to think that once a name was \xe2\x80\x9cclaimed\xe2\x80\x9d it was no longer possible for another app to have the exact same name.  This isn\xe2\x80\x99t true. Whether by guile or glitch I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen many instances where a name has been duplicated exactly.Beyond direct duplication you can also indirectly duplicate an app by adding text or characters to the end of the name.  Just do a search for \xe2\x80\x9cFlashlight\xe2\x80\x9d in the App Store to see what this looks like.  This is often also done to improve search ranking in the Store.Search optimization is an important part of getting your app in front of your customers.  Your app\xe2\x80\x99s name (whether just a name or name-plus-tagline) and keywords are the only texts used in search so what you choose for this is very important. This is another area where being more generic can be useful.  Naming your app Camera+, Camera Awesome, or Camera Plus gives you immediate advantage for people going to the store and searching for \xe2\x80\x9ccamera\xe2\x80\x9d apps.Higher PowersTrademarks are the legal means of protecting your name and preventing customer confusion.  Not everything can be trademarked, nor does getting a trademark solve all your problems.As with most things involving lawyers it is only partially a question of who  is \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d in a trademark dispute.  It is who can fight the longest, best fight and convince the highest power to take their side.  I know of many stories of \xe2\x80\x9clittle guys\xe2\x80\x9d getting trampled by someone who had the budget mount legal battles that the rightful owner just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sustain.Apple generally seems to have a two tier approach to disputes.  When it is a clear violation of an valid, simple trademark they are very quick to act.  When things start to get more gray and complicated they step back and let the parties work it out between themselves.  I think this approach makes a lot of sense and while it can be frustrating if you are fighting the later case its really the most reasonable approach for them to take.General recommendationsThe easiest way to avoid his whole thing is to try and name your apps in as unique a manner as possible.  Invent a name and then market around that.  You can incorporate parts of the generic terms to make it more recognizable (e.g. Fantastical).  You loose the native search optimization of this but can easily make up for that using your keywords.Trademark your name and hope for the best, realizing that whatever you do you may need to get a lawyer involved at some point., Lessons learned from launching Pedometer++ 2.0.

While talking with my wife, Lauren, about what was going on our resulting discussion got interesting.  I recorded it and thought I\xe2\x80\x99d post it here.  She sits at an interesting intersection between a typical App Store customer and someone who knows the business realities of running an indie app company.Please excuse my audio quality.  I only have a single proper microphone, so I had her record with that while I used a USB headset.We start off talking about some implications of Realmac\xe2\x80\x99s decision to backpedal on the pricing structure for Clear.  How the decision to offer a paid, separate upgrade creates a situation where customers are apt to seek out other alternatives.  The dynamics of this seem to play out differently than doing an in-app upgrade.The fear of wasting money in purchasing apps and how that can often drive people towards free apps simply because the apparent risks are so much lower.  One of the implications of this fear or hesitation is that purchases made within an app are much less daunting than purchases directly from the App Store.How social proof and personal recommendations can drive purchases in a way that less personal marketing never does.The misconception that the App Store is stocked by Apple directly rather than by independent 3rd Party apps.   This sets up unrealistic expectations with customers about what is sustainable and reasonable to expect from developers. How Apple\xe2\x80\x99s decision to make the iWork suite free feeds into this perception with customers that Apps should come free with their devices with infinite free updates.The role that good customer service can provide to personalize and humanize your relationship with customers.  This can serve as a great avenue both for their continued support and to help give them a realistic set of expectations., Thursday, September 26, 2013 - Introducing Pod Wrangler.

aS'Money makes the world go around, faster and faster every day. On NPR\'s Planet Money, you\'ll meet high rollers, brainy economists and regular folks -- all trying to make sense of our rapidly changing global economy., &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;There\'s a term in economics, arbitrage, that basically means free money. It\'s finding a difference in price, a pricing mistake, you can exploit to make money. Arbitrage is a risk-free way to buy low and sell high. Everyday there are loads of people and sophisticated computer algorithms searching for an arbitrage opportunity, but true arbitrages are almost impossible to find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Today on the show, we meet two guys who say they\'ve found one, and we visit the storage locker in Utah where they keep their secret.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;A gallon of gas is selling at some pumps for less than $3 right now. The price has been falling since early summer, and local TV news reporters are out at gas stations asking people \'how happy do you feel?\'&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Today on the show, two stories from the other side of the pump. Stories about the people who get the oil out of the ground. We meet a producer that you never hear from. And tell the story of an organization so powerful that it ruled the global economy. Or people thought it did.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;For more:&amp;#160;http://n.pr/1shpEMo&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;In big-time college football or basketball, money is everywhere. From giant TV contracts, to million-dollar coaches\' salaries, to deals with shoe companies. But it\'s against NCAA rules for colleges to pay athletes. On today\'s show, we ask: Is the NCAA\'s ban on paying athletes legal?&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;In Nigeria, millions of gallons of oil are stolen all the time. There are advertisements for stolen oil on the Nigerian version of Craigslist, and not JUST small containers. The advertisements are for giant tankers full of oil. &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Today on the show, how to steal hundreds of thousands of oil every single day. To steal oil takes an entire global system. Lots of people are in on it. Small time crooks and criminal bosses, the owners of oil tankers and corrupt officials. We\'ll show you how they get away with it. &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;For more:&amp;#160;http://n.pr/1wdEoB4&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Today\'s show is a rerun.

The absentee rate was around 10 percent.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;People called in sick all the time, typically on Mondays, or on days when there was a big soccer game.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Foggia is in southern Italy. Barilla\'s big factory in northern Italy had a much lower absentee rate. This is not surprising; there\'s a huge economic gap between southern and northern Italy. It\'s like two different countries.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Barilla execs told Nicola Calandrea, the manager of the Foggia plant, that they would close the factory unless he brought the absenteeism rate down.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Calandrea decided that to save the factory, he had to change the culture. On today\'s show, we visit the factory and hear how Calandrea made it work.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;For more:&amp;#160;http://n.pr/1w0OpkT&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;Today on the show, a Republican governor lives the dream. He cuts taxes dramatically in his state, and he promises good times ahead. But the good times do not come. Now he\'s fighting for his political life. For more:&amp;#160;http://n.pr/1pBNfq7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Mark Zuckerberg. Bill Gates. Steve Jobs. Most of the big names in technology are men. But a lot of computing pioneers, the ones who programmed the first digital computers, were women. And for decades, the number of women in computer science was growing. But in 1984, something changed. The number of women in computer science flattened, and then plunged. Today on the show, what was going on in 1984 that made so many women give up on computer science? We unravel a modern mystery in the U.S. labor force.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Today\'s show is a rerun. It originally ran in&amp;#160;June 2012.&amp;#160;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;A few years ago, Jestina Clayton started a hair braiding business in her home in Centerville, Utah. The business let her stay home with her kids, and in good months, she made enough to pay for groceries. She even put an ad on a local website. Then one day she got an email from a stranger who had seen the ad.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;"It is illegal in the state of Utah to do any form of extensions without a valid cosmetology license," the e-mail read. "Please delete your ad, or you will be reported."&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;To get a license, Jestina would have to spend more than a year in cosmetology school. Tuition would cost $16,000 dollars or more.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show: Why it was illegal to braid hair without a license in Utah. And why hundreds of licensing rules in states all around the country are a disaster for the U.S. economy. For more:&amp;#160;http://n.pr/1Ddlj3U&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;The popularity of fondue wasn\'t an accident. It was planned by a cartel of Swiss cheese makers, which ruled the Swiss economy for 80 years. On today\'s show: Swiss cheese. A story about what happens when well-meaning folks decide that the rules of economics don\'t apply to them. And got the world to eat gobs of melted fat.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Today\'s show is the story of a guy who tried to make something of himself by getting into a rough business: debt collection. It\'s also the story of the low-level, semi-legal debt-collection economy that sprung up in Buffalo, New York. And, in a small way, it\'s the story of the last 20 or so years in global finance, a time when the world went wild for debt. For more:&amp;#160;http://n.pr/1ndvYHL&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Prices of new textbooks have been going up like crazy. Faster than clothing, food, cars, and even healthcare. Listeners have been asking for years why textbooks are getting so expensive. On today\'s show, we actually find an answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Today on the show: Stories about the secrets of jewelry stores, the problem with World\'s Fairs and a law signed by Abraham Lincoln that\'s being used today to go after the largest banks in the world.&amp;#160;&lt;span style="color: #222222; font-family: \'Source Sans Pro\', sans-serif; line-height: 22px; background-color: #f9f9f9;"&gt;For more:&amp;#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="current-shortlink" style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; position: relative; color: #222222; font-family: \'Source Sans Pro\', sans-serif; line-height: 22px; background-color: #f9f9f9;"&gt;n.pr/&lt;span style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-weight: 600;"&gt;1prjqYP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222; font-family: \'Source Sans Pro\', sans-serif; line-height: 22px; background-color: #f9f9f9;"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Charities raised $1.4 billion to help rebuild Haiti after the earthquake. After the tsunami in Asia in 2004, organizations raised $1.6 billion. But when something like Ebola happens, so far, people look the other way. On today\'s show: What does it take to get people to notice something half a world away, and what does it take to get people to pull out their wallets and donate money.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Today\'s show is a rerun.

That\'s more than double the rate in the U.S., and it\'s a problem for Japan\'s economy. &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;If more women returned to the workforce, it would go a huge way toward boosting growth in the country and solving a big demographic problem &amp;#8212; not enough working people to support the nation\'s retirees. &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;But finding childcare in Japan is even harder than finding childcare in the U.S. The long-term solution is robot nannies. (Really.) On today\'s show: How Japanese working moms can survive until the robots arrive. &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;For more:&amp;#160;&lt;span class="current-shortlink" style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; position: relative; color: #222222; font-family: \'Source Sans Pro\', sans-serif; line-height: 22px; background-color: #f9f9f9;"&gt;n.pr/&lt;span style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-weight: 600;"&gt;1B8omqW&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222; font-family: \'Source Sans Pro\', sans-serif; line-height: 22px; background-color: #f9f9f9;"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we read our homeowners insurance policy. The details are amazing. Lava! Vermin! Falling objects! And, hiding in all the fine print, the story of how insurance works &amp;#8212; and what makes it break.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Alex Blumberg is starting a business, a podcasting business. And he\'s recording himself as he starts the company &amp;#8212; he\'s making a&amp;#160;podcast&amp;#160;about starting his podcasting company. Meta, right? &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;But starting a business can be lonely. Alex wants a partner to share in the stress and the risk, and potential investors say they\'d prefer to bet on a team, too. Today on the show, Alex searches for a business partner. There have been Hewlett and Packard, Procter and Gamble, and Ben and Jerry. Now, there is Blumberg and.... &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Listen to the other episodes in Alex\'s podcast miniseries about starting a company at&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://hearstartup.com/episodes/" target="_blank"&gt;HearStartUp.com&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;Note: There\'s a curse word in today\'s episode. At about 1:25.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;An amazing amount of stuff on the internet is free &amp;#8212; Facebook, Twitter and Gmail. Of course, it\'s not exactly free. We pay, with our data. And right now, we\'re kind of stuck trading our data, for all this free software. Today on the show: two people who want to give you other options. These two people are trying to create services online that collect next to nothing &amp;#8212; virtually no information, no data. A couple years ago, these people might have been dismissed as kooks. But one of them just raised $30 million.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;For years now, the economy has been kind of stuck. The unemployment rate is getting better, but slowly. Household incomes have actually been falling. It\'s easy to feel stuck. Today on the show, stories of two people trying to get unstuck.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Zoo animals are different than most possessions, because zoos follow a fundamental principle: You can\'t sell or buy the animals.

What that company means for China, for the rest of us and for some chickens in California.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;For more:&amp;#160;http://n.pr/1oEZY9J&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Some people write a squiggle. Others just write an initial. One person draws a dude surfing. Today on the show: the signature. It\'s supposed to say, "This is me." But where did the idea come from? And why are we still using it? We consult a rabbi, a lawyer and a credit card executive.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;The world is full of people talking about how right they are. Today on the show, we try something different: We talk to smart, thoughtful people about times they got things really, really wrong. For more:&amp;#160;http://n.pr/1lfnG0Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;The Westfield Valley Fair Mall in California is like any other mall except for one thing: half of the mall is in the city of San Jose and the other half is in the city of Santa Clara. The boundary line runs right through the mall. For a long time, this didn\'t matter. But in 2012, one city &amp;#8212; San Jose &amp;#8212; raised its minimum wage from $8 an hour to $10 an hour. This change created two economic worlds within a single, large building. Employees doing more or less the same work, just steps away from each other, started making different wages. On today\'s show: minimum wage stories from a single mall. What happens when some stores suddenly have to pay their workers more &amp;#8212; and others are still paying less.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Today\'s show is a rerun. It originally ran in&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/09/11/221417806/episode-485-whats-your-major" target="_blank"&gt;September 2013&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Sure, some college degrees lead to higher paying jobs than others. But what\'s shocking &amp;#8212; at least, it was shocking to us &amp;#8212; is just how big the gap can be. The most lucrative majors typically lead to jobs with salaries over $100,000 a year. The least lucrative lead to salaries of around $30,000. On today\'s show, we run the numbers. We talk to people who majored in the most- and least-lucrative subjects. And we hear from an economist who says, when it comes to income, choosing a major is more important than choosing a college.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"&gt;We spend a lot of time thinking about the future and planning for the future. Fifty years ago, people at the 1964 World\'s Fair built their vision of the future. They imagined a world of jet-packs, steel, glass, and Formica. And they committed to it in a park in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"&gt;Today on the show, we visit that park and visit the future as seen from the World\'s Fair in 1964. And we see how the future actually turned out.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;The 100 dollar bill is the most popular product from the Federal Reserve. Eighty percent of all U.S. cash is in the form of 100 dollar bills, but you rarely see them. About twenty years ago, the Fed counted up all the hundreds it knew about &amp;#8212; money in bank vaults and cash registers &amp;#8212; and it found it had no idea where most of the hundred dollar bills had gone. And so they went on a mission to find them. Today on the show, where in the world are all the 100 dollar bills? What is Benjamin Franklin being used for? And if we don\'t know where they all are, should the U.S. keep making them?&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Thousands of&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2014307190012" target="_blank"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;in Detroit haven\'t paid their water bills.

Today on the show, how a bankrupt city is dealing with the most basic of problems &amp;#8212; how to get people to pay their bills.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Today\'s show is a rerun.

This program &amp;#8212; a massive redistribution of wealth &amp;#8212; has been embraced by every president from Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we look at a huge, often overlooked, surprisingly interesting corner of the tax code: The Earned Income Tax Credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;For more, see our story&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/03/15/174358638/a-surprisingly-uncontroversial-program-that-gives-money-to-poor-people" target="_blank"&gt;A Surprisingly Uncontroversial Program That Gives Money To Poor People&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"&gt;Super PACs let rich people, corporations and unions spend as much money as they want to try to influence the outcome of elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"&gt;On today\'s show: How a Harvard professor created a&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://mayday.us/" target="_blank"&gt;super PAC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/span&gt;to attack super PACs. He\'s raised millions of dollars &amp;#8212; in part from really rich people &amp;#8212; to reduce the political influence of really rich people.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;In most parts of the world, refugees are not allowed to work. But Mohammed Osman Ali is a refugee in Uganda, and there, he legally runs a video game arcade and a variety store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Today on the show, why most countries won\'t let refugees work. And why Uganda is trying something different.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Today we build our show from three short Planet Money stories. We look at when a dollar is not worth a dollar; publishing without a publisher; and, of course, Ikea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;For more:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;*&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/07/11/329586422/when-ikea-raises-its-minimum-wage-where-does-the-money-come-from" target="_blank"&gt;When Ikea Raises Its Minimum Wage, Where Does The Money Come From?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;*&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/07/22/334082441/money-markets-easy-to-ignore-but-dicier-than-youd-think" target="_blank"&gt;Money Markets: Easy To Ignore, Occasionally Dicey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;*&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/07/25/334484331/unknown-authors-make-a-living-self-publishing" target="_blank"&gt;Self-Published Authors Make A Living &amp;#8212; And Sometimes A Fortune&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Milk is often in the very back corner of the grocery store, as far as humanly possible from the entrance. It\'s a strange location for milk, because it\'s one the most popular items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;A common explanation for this location is that by forcing customers to walk through the whole store, they will pass more products and end up purchasing more. But is that really why the milk is in the back? Can you really have a business model intentionally built around inconveniencing your customers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Today on the show, two big theories to answer this little question: Why is the milk in the back of the store? The theories reflect very different world views. To try to discover which is right, we host a friendly debate between food writer&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://michaelpollan.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Michael Pollan&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;and economist&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.hoover.org/fellows/russell-roberts" target="_blank"&gt;Russ Roberts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;We all know what a sandwich is. It\'s something delicious, slapped between two slices of bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;But when it comes to taxes, nothing is simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Today on the show, what regulating sandwiches and all other takeout food tells us about taxation. And how something as simple as the sandwich sales tax ends up spawning a complicated list of definitions, interlocking exemptions and rules which somehow transform the burrito into a sandwich in the eyes of the law.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;As World War 2 was ending, world leaders realized they had a problem. Countries no longer knew how to trade with each other. Their economies were devastated. So representatives from 44 nations gathered in the small town of Bretton Woods, New Hampshire to come up with the solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;It came down to two different plans put forward by two very different men. One was the most famous economist in the world. A British aristocrat. The other was an American that no one remembers. But it was the American that won the day and put the U.S. dollar right in the middle of world trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Today on the show, how the US won. The story involves a carefully laid trap, late night dancing and copious amounts of alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;The price of tickets for lots of things &amp;#8212; baseball games, many Broadway musicals, plane trips &amp;#8212; rises and falls based on how much demand there is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when you go to the movies, a ticket to the empty theater playing a bomb is exactly the same price as a ticket to the sold-out blockbuster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s the show, we try to find out why.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Tesla, the electric car company, recently decided to, basically, give up its patents. Anybody who wants to is now free to steal the company\'s ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Elon Musk, the company\'s CEO said he isn\'t really into patents &amp;#8212; and, he said, he thinks giving them up is best for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we talk to two guys who say we should get rid of patents altogether. If someone has an idea, anyone else is free to steal it.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Today\'s show is a rerun. It originally ran on &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/07/09/200401407/episode-471-the-eddie-murphy-rule"&gt;July 2013&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we talk to commodities traders to answer one of the most important questions in finance: What actually happens at the end of Trading Places?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know something crazy happens on the trading floor. We know that Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd get rich and the Duke brothers lose everything. But how does it all happen? And could it happen in the real world?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also on the show: The "Eddie Murphy Rule" that wound up in the the big financial overhaul law Congress passed in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today\'s special guest co-host is Roman Mars, host of &lt;a href="http://99percentinvisible.org/" target="_blank"&gt;99% Invisible&lt;/a&gt;. (Check out their episode on the &lt;a href="http://99percentinvisible.org/post/23191508700/episode-54-the-colour-of-money" target="_blank"&gt;design of U.S. currency&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;In most workplaces, salaries are secret. But what if they weren\'t? What if everybody knew what everyone else made?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we visit a company in New York that practices pay transparency &amp;#8212; and we hear how it changes the dynamic between employees and the boss.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;The dream of socialist North Korea was that the government would control every part of the economy. No need for private businesses or stores - the state would give you everything. People were not supposed to sell to each other. Ever. On today\'s show: how markets sprung up anyway.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 13.63636302947998px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Today\'s show is a rerun.

Up 63 percent from the price a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 13.63636302947998px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;At least, that\'s the sticker price &amp;#8212; the price you get if you add up tuition, room and board, and all the fees listed on the school\'s website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 13.63636302947998px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;But there\'s a huge gap between the sticker price and what the average student actually pays after figuring in grants and scholarships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 13.63636302947998px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;That\'s true at private colleges around the country. Nationwide, the average sticker price is more than twice as high as the price students actually pay, and the gap is getting wider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 13.63636302947998px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;It turns out, it makes economic sense to have a high sticker price and offer lots of discounts. On the show today, we explain why.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Planet Money\'s Steve Henn wanted to know how much someone could learn about him by just sitting back and watching his internet traffic flow by. So he invited a couple computer guys to bug his internet connection for a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show: What they discovered, and what that tells us about security, smartphones and free WiFi.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 13.63636302947998px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;One of the biggest banks in the world, BNP Paribas, is about to be punished. The financial cops are in the middle of deciding what they are going to do. They\'re trying to figure out how to punish a bank in a way that actually makes it change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 13.63636302947998px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;There are some standard ways to punish a bad bank. Fines are the first thing every regulator and judge tries. There\'s also getting the bank to admit guilt. Now they might try something never done before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 13.63636302947998px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Today on the show: how to punish a bank.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;Today on the show: Stories about bored traders, a bank that charges customers to deposit money, and a pawn shop for the rich.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Certain things are just hard to improve on. The classic example: the mousetrap. Also: the paperclip. And, the super-size version: the pallet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its way, the pallet is perfect. A few pieces of cheap lumber nailed together, without an extra nail or board. It keeps things a few inches off the floor and works with a forklift. Amazing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This perfect system of moving stuff around on pallets has been around for a long time. And for basically 50 years, no one really improved on it in this country. Until they did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today on the show: yes you can build a better pallet.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;The other day we noticed something strange: a pack of Milk Chocolate M&amp;M\'s weighs 1.69 ounces, but a pack of Peanut Butter M&amp;M\'s weigh a tiny tiny bit less, 1.63 ounces. The two packs are same price, but you get slightly less of the Peanut Butter M&amp;Ms! 0.06 ounces less! It turns out there is a whole weird world living down there at the third decimal place. When you pull on that little thread, lots of things start to unravel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After today\'s show, you will never pop a piece of candy in your mouth and think about it the same way again.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 13.63636302947998px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Today\'s show is a re-run. It originally ran in July 2013.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 13.63636302947998px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Climate change seems like this complicated, intractable problem. But maybe it doesn\'t have to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 13.63636302947998px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we talk to a couple economists about a very simple idea that could solve the climate-change problem: tax carbon emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 13.63636302947998px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;A carbon tax could be paired with cuts in the income tax. And it would drive down emissions without picking winners or losers, and without creating complicated regulations.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 13.63636302947998px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;There\'s this big idea floating around right now. It sounds crazy and fringey, but it turns out some non-crazy, non-fringey people are into it. The idea is this: let\'s get rid of the banks. Don\'t make them safer. Don\'t make them smaller. Just get rid of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 13.63636302947998px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show: A world without banks.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;When we talk about European economy, we usually focus on the screw ups &amp;#8211; the sunny South, with the big deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the strangest report recently came out of Brussels&amp;#8212;saying how well Germany\'s economy is doing. And how that\'s a big problem for the rest of the countries in the Eurozone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today on the show: How when you\'re in a group, doing extremely well can be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Tons of entrepreneurs have come up with clever ways to make money using little drones: farmers, who want to spot aphids on their soybean plants; ranchers trying to find lost cows; crews wanting to film shiny cars cruising on windy roads. There\'s just this one little problem &amp;#8211; according to the Federal Aviation Administration &amp;#8211; all these people- they are breaking the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Today on the show: drones are proliferating, but who owns the air? If you buy a house, you know you own the ground. But what about the space above it? Who exactly, owns that?&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Today on the show we have three radio stories for you about the strange ways people think about their the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first Ashley Milne-Tyte talks to two graduates &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/05/05/308352614/seeking-a-fortune-through-search-funds"&gt;Seeking A Fortune Through Search Funds&lt;/a&gt;. Then David Kestenbaum tells us &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/04/24/306542078/how-one-state-convinced-its-young-invincibles-to-get-health-insurance"&gt;How One State Convinced Its \'Young Invincibles\' To Get Health Insurance&lt;/a&gt;. And in the last story Jacob Goldstein explains &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/05/15/312674256/why-inflation-is-low-and-likely-to-stay-there"&gt;Why Inflation Is So Low&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Today on the show: The penny. And the strange spot it occupies in our economy. It\'s worth almost nothing, but not quite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;We have three stories on the penny. First, we go on an expedition through the streets of Manhattan to find something, anything, we can buy for one cent. Next, we talk to a guy who\'s betting on the government killing the penny. And finally, we visit a place where people dream of how pennies could change everything: the internet.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Today\'s show is a re-run. It originally ran in January 2012.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1978, a group of farmers in a Chinese village called Xiaogang wrote a secret contract and hid it in the roof of a mud hut.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; They were afraid the document might get them executed. Instead, it wound up completely transforming the Chinese economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we travel to Xiaogang, and hear the farmers\' story.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;A trumpet is more or less a trumpet. A clarinet is a clarinet. But violin or a viola... they are different. More like living breathing things. Hand crafted from wood, from a tree. Every one is different. And, you know the story. Antonio Stradivari, was the master. Some say the greatest violin maker to ever live. The Stradivarius is one of the most powerful and expensive brands in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;And certainly, the guy made really nice instruments. But how nice exactly. This is a question that comes up all the time with all kinds of products: coffee, clothes, dish washing detergent, jeans and shoes. How much of a brand is real? And how much is in our heads?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Of course you could do a test with a stradivarius to answer this exact question. And In fact, in 2010, researchers did just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;If you thought Daft Punk was saying something about a Mexican monkey when they were actually singing "up all night to get lucky" &amp;#8212; you\'re not alone. There are more than five million searches for lyrics on Google every day.*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there is a big fight going on over who should make money off those searches: is it the websites who put the lyrics up? Or the songwriters, who put the words together?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From George Washington to Rick Ross, this country has been trying for hundreds of years to figure out &amp;#8212; what\'s the difference between fair use and stealing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Source: LyricFind*&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;In a lot of ways, the job looks the same as ever &amp;#8212; the brown truck, the dogs, the lady coming out to apologize about the dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underneath the surface, though, Bill Earle\'s job as a driver for UPS, has changed a lot. When Bill started back in the \'90s, he was a guy out there by himself, alone in a truck on an empty road. UPS was a trucking company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, it\'s a technology company. Every step Bill takes, every mile he drives, is tracked. His truck is a rolling computer. From the time he punches in in the morning until he gets back to base at night, the company is trying to figure out how Bill can do his job quicker, more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology means that no matter what kind of job you have &amp;#8212; whether you\'re alone in a truck on an empty road or sitting in a cubicle in front of a computer &amp;#8212; your company can now track everything you do.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;When a famine swept through Somalia in 2011, it was hard for aid workers to get food distributed. Most of the country was too dangerous for non-Somalis to do the work. Instead, the United Nations looked at satellite images of camps filling up with tents and dispatched locals to deliver the food. A local industry around distributing aid and sheltering the poor sprung up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we visit a country with almost no government, but a lot of entrepreneurs. And we see what happens when locals decide to make money by becoming humanitarians for profit.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On today\'s show: How we got from dim little candles made out of cow fat, to as much light as we want at the flick of a switch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The history of light explains why the world today is what it is. It explains why we aren\'t all subsistence farmers, and why we can afford to have artists and massage therapists and plumbers.

He\'s trying to make high-quality wine, from grapes he grows in New Jersey. But Jersey wine already has a reputation &amp;#8212; and fancy isn\'t it.

There is a different set of standards in Europe. To sell a Jeep Wrangler in Europe, Chrysler has to redesign and replace a bunch of seemingly random parts of the car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Europeans have the same issue. The new Volkswagen Golf R is driving on the autobahns in Berlin, but not yet in the US. Before the car can come to the US, the German company has to manufacture the car for a completely different set of safety regulations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today on the show: why can&amp;#8217;t you build a car that can be driven anywhere in the world?&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;There are over 100 million websites ending in .com. But new options for website names are becoming available. Not only is there .com and .gov .edu, but now .ninja has been added. Also .bike, .plumbing and .cool. In all, over 1000 new &amp;#8216;top-level domains&amp;#8217; as they are called will be added. &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today on the show, what happens when you just create a whole bunch of real estate out of nowhere? We meet some of the new land barons with big dreams.

And the IRS seems powerless to stop them.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#8217;t just a problem in the U.S. American taxpayers are Dudley Do-Rights compared to people in some other countries. On today\'s show, we head to some of the cheating-est places on earth to bring you tales from some of the roughest, toughest tax collectors around. These guys have tricks, tax collector mind-games, that they play to get people to do the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;After today\'s show, you\'ll be ready to design a tax on marijuana, pick a law school, and explain centuries of inequality &amp;#8212; and the hottest book in economics &amp;#8212; without having to read a page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more on these stories, see:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/11/22/246743018/whats-the-best-way-to-tax-marijuana-it-depends-on-what-you-want"&gt;What\'s The Best Way To Tax Marijuana?

No matter how slow. No matter how bad the customer service. There isn\'t much choice. But, this isn\'t true for people in lots of other countries. In Europe, in parts of Asia, there is a real choice of who brings your internet to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today on the show: Why do Americans have so few options when buying internet service?

Every year, it\'s been the same thing over and over. The official statistics come out, and the news is bad. The economy shrank this year, the economy shrank this year, the economy shrank this year.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;But this year, things might be different.* The official forecasts are that the amazing shrinking economy will finally stop shrinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;This might sound like good news, but for people living in Greece it\'s been a painful process. Elias Tilligadas is a government food inspector in Greece. Recently, his pay was cut 45 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;"The numbers are getting better; the people are getting worse," Elias says. "Our lives are getting worse."&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;There are reportedly tens of thousands of Russian troops on the Eastern Ukrainian border. The Russians have already taken control of the Crimean Peninsula; what was once Ukraine is now Russia. But, the United States and the rest of Europe refuse to recognize this. There might be an actual war soon, but not this week. For now, the battle is financial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s episode: how to use money as a weapon. Can you stop one of the biggest militaries in the world with sanctions?&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;We all know how lousy a recession feels. And we know how much long-term damage a recession can cause. &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;But there\'s still a lot we don\'t know about recessions &amp;#8212; like, if you\'re in a recession, what\'s the best way to get out? &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Today, we tackle the question of how to escape a recession, by going small. Economist Tim Harford walks us through two tiny self-contained economies, a babysitting co-op and a prisoner of war camp, facing what he calls "toy recessions."&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Today\'s show is a re-run.

Why can\'t you just go to a car store and shop for cars from a bunch of different manufacturers? Why don\'t cars have real price tags &amp;#8212; with real prices, that people actually pay? &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Today on the show: Why car buying is so unpleasant, and what your local legislators may be doing to keep it that way.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;If you want to send a bunch of oranges by truck from Florida to Baltimore, no one cares who made the truck. Or if you want to fly computer chips across the country, it\'s fine if the plane is made in France. But if you want send cargo by ship, there\'s a law that the ship has to be American made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here\'s why: a 90-year-old law, called the Jones Act. Every time you want to send something from one US port to another, the cargo must travel on a ship built in the US, staffed by mostly Americans, and flying the American flag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today on the show, we look at the all the unexpected places this law pops up: on cruise ships, cattle farms, and in New Jersey, where a guy really, really needs salt.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- if gte mso 9]&gt;&lt;xml&gt;

And how that led, in part, to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;If you asked someone on the street 100 years ago, "How\'s the economy doing?"

And how that number made people think they could control everything.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;People in La Crosse, Wisconsin are used to talking about death. In fact, 96 percent of people who die in this small, Midwestern city have specific directions laid out for when they pass. That number is astounding. Nationwide, it\'s more like 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In today\'s episode, we\'ll take you to a place where dying has become acceptable dinner conversation for teenagers and senior citizens alike. A place that also happens to have the lowest healthcare spending of any region in the country.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;College is expensive these days. Yet, most universities argue an undergraduate education is actually worth much more than what students pay for it. Clearly there is an emotional logic to this argument. But what do the numbers tell us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In today\'s episode, Planet Money takes a behind the scenes look at Duke\'s balance sheet and considers the university\'s case that $60,000 a year is actually a discount.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;From billion-dollar bailouts to Occupy Wall Street, it\'s safe to say the financial crisis didn\'t exactly paint a great picture of the banking industry. It\'s precisely that stigma that drove Kevin Roose to follow a group of young Wall Street recruits around for three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In today\'s episode, Roose takes us behind the scenes of some of the largest banks, their secret societies and the young people escaping it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;A 30-year old woman finds out she has a viral infection attacking her heart that will kill her unless she has a transplant. Four years later she gets a new heart and goes on to summit Mt. Kilimanjaro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Inspiring story right? Will it move you to become an organ donor? Not necessarily. And that\'s a problem for the 120 thousand people waiting for organs in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Behavior change is hard. That\'s something that organ donor advocates know firsthand.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://organdonor.gov/dtcp/nationalsurveyorgandonation.pdf"&gt;Polls indicate&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;most Americans support organ donations, but less than half are actually registered as donors. So how do you get people to make the leap from thought to action?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;In today\'s show, the story of one woman who believes she is close to an answer by partnering with one of the more hated American institutions.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="padding-top: 12px; color: #22242f; font-family: \'Open Sans\', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 20.15999984741211px; background-color: #f2f2f2; font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;It\'s cheap to fly on Spirit Airlines, but you have to pay extra for perks. And by perks, we mean a bottle of water or space in the overhead bin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="padding-top: 12px; color: #22242f; font-family: \'Open Sans\', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 20.15999984741211px; background-color: #f2f2f2; font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;It\'s totally rational: pay for what you use, don\'t pay for what you don\'t use. And it\'s increasingly popular: Spirit is the fastest growing airline in America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="padding-top: 12px; color: #22242f; font-family: \'Open Sans\', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 20.15999984741211px; background-color: #f2f2f2; font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;And yet. Lots of people really don\'t like Spirit Airlines. In a&amp;#160;&lt;a style="color: #22242f;" href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2013/07/best-worst-airlines/index.htm?loginMethod=auto" target="_blank"&gt;Consumer Reports survey&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;published last year, Spirit finished last among U.S. airlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="padding-top: 12px; color: #22242f; font-family: \'Open Sans\', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 20.15999984741211px; background-color: #f2f2f2; font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;How is the fastest growing airline also the least popular? On today\'s show, we fly Spirit Airlines to Florida and ask the CEO.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;LeBron James, the best basketball player in the NBA, makes $17.5 million a year. He is the most underpaid professional athlete in the world today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we explain why LeBron is getting hosed &amp;#8212; and why that\'s probably a good thing for NBA fans, team owners, other pro players, and even LeBron himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This episode originally aired in January of 2013.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Here\'s the scenario: A man and his wife are desperate to get to the hospital because she is about to deliver a baby. It\'s a hot summer day. It\'s rush hour. They flag down a private car and ask, "How much?" To their surprise the driver wants to charge them four times the normal price of a cab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, is this a story about a cabbie taking advantage of a vulnerable couple or is it simply good economics?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we are talking about a company that charges people in desperate situations more for a ride, and we\'ll consider the argument that it might actually be better for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Ben Horowitz is a big-time venture capitalist. His firm&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://a16z.com/portfolio/" target="_blank"&gt;invested in Facebook and Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. More recently, his firm&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/why-bitcoin-matters/" target="_blank"&gt;invested some $50 million&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;in startups related to bitcoin, the virtual currency that works like online cash. Ben thinks bitcoin is going to change the way people buy and sell stuff on the Internet. &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Felix Salmon, a high-profile&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/" target="_blank"&gt;finance blogger at Reuters&lt;/a&gt;, is a prominent bitcoin skeptic. &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;So when Felix recently&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://news.rapgenius.com/Felix-salmon-the-bitcoin-bubble-and-the-future-of-currency-annotated" target="_blank"&gt;published an essay&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;calling bitcoin a bubble that was sure to burst, Ben&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://news.rapgenius.com/2654544" target="_blank"&gt;posted a comment&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;challenging him to a bet over the future of bitcoin. &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;"I said, \'Why don\'t we just bet?\'" Ben told us. "And I\'ve read enough of Felix\'s stuff to know that would be irresistible to him." &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;"He\'s right about that," Felix said. "Being challenged by Ben Horowitz is kind of a high point of my career. So I immediately said yes." &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;When we heard about the challenge, we invited Felix and Ben to come on Planet Money to hash out the details of the bet. Basically, we offered to be their bookie. Fortunately for us, they accepted. &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;For more on the bet, see our post:&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/02/05/272077743/a-venture-capitalist-is-betting-a-pair-of-socks-and-50-million-on-bitcoins-futur" target="_blank"&gt;A Venture Capitalist Is Betting A Pair Of Socks (And $50 Million) On Bitcoin\'s Future&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Tomato inflation in South America.

This one came from 17-year-old, Arthur, who lives in Pittsburgh:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;I am a senior in high school and I have never been on a date. Should I be worried about this? When I do finally meet someone, will I be hurt by my inexperience?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, economist and author, Tim Harford, applies economic theory to Arthur\'s question. He also tackles polyamory and offers suggestions on how to change your spouse\'s behavior.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the mountains of Oaxaca, in southern Mexico, there are basically no jobs. Villages are empty of young men, who go elsewhere in Mexico or to the U.S. to find work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we meet two cousins from Oaxaca who dream of bringing jobs to their village. Their strategy: Launch a startup to make mezcal, a popular local liquor &amp;#8212; then get people in the U.S. to buy it.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show: Three stories about people who, intentionally or not, found themselves breaking the rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;1.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/12/13/250656131/a-gridlock-economy-springs-up-in-a-city-with-terrible-traffic" target="_blank"&gt;In A City With Terrible Traffic, A Gridlock Economy Emerges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;2.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/01/17/263101422/why-u-s-taxpayers-started-and-stopped-paying-brazilian-cotton-farmers" target="_blank"&gt;Why U.S. Taxpayers Started &amp;#8212; And Stopped &amp;#8212; Paying Brazilian Cotton Farmers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;3.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/01/10/261399429/how-a-community-bank-tripped-on-footnote-1-861-of-the-volcker-rule" target="_blank"&gt;How A Community Bank Tripped On Footnote 1,861 Of The Volcker Rule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;For most of U.S. history, there was no minimum wage. A few times, politicians passed laws tiptoeing toward a minimum. But the Supreme Court struck those laws down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show: how the U.S. finally got a minimum wage. It\'s a story of exploding bakeries, a blue eagle, and a guy who may or may not have been drunk.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;To hire new employees, some companies are paying less attention to resumes and more attention to data &amp;#8212; and the data are leading to some surprising findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we take a weird hiring test for a call-center job. And we hear what does (and doesn\'t) predict success for everyone from call-center workers to software developers.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This episode was originally posted in 2011.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you know the right people &amp;#8212; and if you can get other criminals to vouch for you &amp;#8212; you can go online and buy huge bundles of stolen credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, Planet Money knows the right people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we sit in with Keith Mularski of the FBI. Mularski got so deep into this world that he wound up running a major criminal website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He takes us to a giant online mall for stolen credit cards, where vendors offer discounts for repeat customers and banners advertise hacking and phishing tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;A famous biologist predicts overpopulation will lead to global catastrophe. He writes a bestselling book and goes on the Tonight Show to make his case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;An economist disagrees. He thinks the biologist isn\'t accounting for how clever people can be, and how shortages can lead to new, more efficient ways of doing things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;So the economist, Julian Simon, challenges the biologist, Paul Ehrlich, to a very public, very acrimonious, decade-long bet. On today\'s show: The story of that bet, and the ugly precedent it set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;For more, see&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300176483" target="_blank"&gt;The Bet&lt;/a&gt;, by Yale historian Paul Sabin. We talk to Sabin on today\'s show.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we follow up on a few of the stories we did in 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hear what happened to a billion-dollar bet against a company that sells weight loss shakes, how a Washington marijuana shop found a bank. Also, we find the owner of a 20-year-old bat mitzvah T-shirt that traveled from Michigan to Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, a story on a Christmasy theme: Handbells!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;But also, a not-so-Christmasy theme: A decades-long feud between two big bell companies, located right down the road from each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;But then, a Christmasy ending: Peace!&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we tell the creation story of the Federal Reserve &amp;#8212; one of the most powerful financial institutions on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story includes a 70-year-old man with a bad head cold and a bunch of mistresses, a nation that\'s deeply ambivalent about a central bank, and a secret meeting at an island with a sketchy name.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;There\'s one part of Obamacare that doesn\'t get mentioned a lot, but that could end up being a big deal. It sets up experiments in hospitals all over the country to try to figure out how to save money without lowering the quality of care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we visit a hospital in Akron, Ohio that\'s engaged in one of these experiments. We sit in on a tense conversation where doctors argue about why it\'s so hard to start surgery on time. And we hear what happens when you change the way hospitals and doctors get paid.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Today\'s show is the final installment of the &lt;a href="http://npr.org/shirt" target="_blank"&gt;Planet Money T-shirt project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all, each shirt cost us about $12.42. We open up the books and explain how that breaks down &amp;#8212;&amp;#160; how much went to cotton, how much went to the workers in Bangladesh, and how much went places we would never have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Charities like Goodwill sell or give away some of the used clothes they get. But a lot of the clothes get sold, packed in bales and sent across the ocean in a container ship. The U.S. exports over a billion pounds of used clothing every year &amp;#8212; and much of that winds up in used clothing markets in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we visit a giant used-clothing market in Nairobi, Kenya to see what happens to American clothes (including, presumably, some Planet Money T-shirts) after Americans are done with them.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, the Planet Money T-shirts arrive at the Port of Miami. But they\'re not quite here yet. If you\'ve ever waited at an airport to clear customs, you can understand where our shirts are now: waiting for permission to enter the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standing between our shirts and the rest of America is a 3,000 page book. The book is a powerful force that creates and destroys entire industries around the world. Squadrons of government agents use tools of violence and destruction to ensure that the rules laid out in the book are followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the book tells us how much we\'ll have to pay in taxes to import our T-shirt into the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On today\'s show: the story of an often-overlooked innovation that\'s essential to the global economy. The innovation is a box. A big, metal box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The standard shipping container has completely transformed commerce in the past 50 years. It\'s part of the reason the Planet Money men\'s T-shirt comes from cotton grown in Mississippi, spun into yarn in Indonesia, and sewn together in Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we see the shipping container in action, and hear the story behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For much more, see the &lt;a href="http://apps.npr.org/tshirt/#/boxes" target="_blank"&gt;\'Boxes\' chapter&lt;/a&gt; of our &lt;a href="http://apps.npr.org/tshirt/#/title" target="_blank"&gt;online T-shirt project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;The nation of Bangladesh was created out of chaos in the early 1970s, at a moment when millions in the country were dying from a combination of war and famine. The future looked exceedingly bleak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abdul Majid Chowdhury and Noorul Quader were Bangladeshi businessmen who wanted to help their country. "We asked ourselves, \'What the hell do we want?\' " Chowdhury recalls. The answer he and his friends arrived at: "We need employment. We need dollars."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their solution involved Richard Nixon, an obscure but hugely influential trade deal, and a cultural struggle over kimchi.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;The Planet Money men\'s T-shirts were made in Bangladesh. The Planet Money women\'s T-shirts were made in Colombia. On today\'s show, we move from Bangladesh to Colombia &amp;#8212; and we see an entirely different world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s a world where workers make more money and work under better conditions than their counterparts in Bangladesh. But it\'s also a world that may not last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/archives/archive.php?thingId=190719989" target="_blank"&gt;all of our T-shirt stories&lt;/a&gt; so far.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Today\'s show is about love and betrayal. It\'s about the lives of two sisters who worked on the Planet Money T-shirt. And it\'s about the social upheaval that has followed the rise of the garment industry in Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We\'ll have much more on Bangladesh and the rest of the T-shirt story in future shows. Here are our &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/archives/archive.php?thingId=190719989" target="_blank"&gt;previous stories from the series&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;After years of planning and months of production, the Planet Money T-shirts are here. They\'ll be in the mail soon. We promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shirts were touched by people in rich countries with advanced degrees and by people working for some of the lowest wages in the world. They traveled thousands of miles across three continents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next several weeks, we\'ll tell the story of the shirts, and of the world behind them. Today, we begin at the beginning: where the cotton in our shirt came from.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Payday lenders made about $49 billion in high-interest loans last year. More than forty percent of those loans were made online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we go looking for the people making these loans and find a bizarre online marketplace where people\'s personal financial information is bought and sold. Plus, we talk to state regulators about why it\'s so hard to police high interest lending happening online.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;There\'s a charity called GiveDirectly that gives money to poor people in Kenya &amp;#8212; no strings attached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we did &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/10/25/240590433/what-happens-when-you-just-give-money-to-poor-people" target="_blank"&gt;a story about GiveDirectly&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, they told us we needed to check back in. It turned out, they were in the middle of a big study designed to figure out what happens when people get money for nothing. Do they invest it? Waste it? Something in between?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the results of the study are in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show: What happens when you give farmers in Kenya more money than they\'ve ever had? Also: giving money to thieves and drug addicts in a country that\'s much worse off than Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This episode originally aired in May of 2013. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in the nineties, Jim Logan started a company called Personal Audio. The concept was simple &amp;#8212; people could pick out magazine articles they liked on the internet, and his company would send them a cassette tape of those articles being read out loud. The cassette tapes didn\'t catch on like Jim hoped, but he had bigger dreams for the idea behind them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He dreamed that one day you wouldn\'t need a cassette player, you would just be able to hear smart people talking about whatever subject you wanted, and that audio would be magically downloaded to a device of your choice. He says he dreamed of podcasting as we know it today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Jim Logan did not create the technology to podcast. He himself is not a modern-day podcaster. But he did get a patent on that big dream of downloading personalized audio, and he claims to have the patent on podcasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, he says all the people out there podcasting today, owe him money.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;" face="Times New Roman" size="3"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;On today\'s show, we talk to Eugene Fama and Robert Shiller, who shared this year\'s economics Nobel. Shiller is a famous explainer of bubbles; Fama is a famous bubble skeptic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;" face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Lincolns used to be the coolest cars in the world. They used to be driven by kings, moguls and celebrities. Today, Lincolns are driven by the old, the out-of-touch, and the guys hustling you at the airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show: How Lincoln is trying to regain its former glory &amp;#8212; and how the story of Lincoln may be the story of the U.S. auto industry, for better or for worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This episode was originally posted last year. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;We recently became obsessed with a strange, select club:The top rated reviewers on Amazon. These are ordinary people &amp;#8212; not Amazon employees &amp;#8212; who write and record hundreds of astonishingly detailed reviews on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this moment, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/top-reviewers" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon\'s number 1 reviewer&lt;/a&gt; is Michael Erb (Amazon screen name, M. Erb). He\'s has reviewed more than 850 products, ranging from telescopes to facial wipes. On today\'s show, we talk to Erb and another top reviewer, and we try to figure out: Why do they spend so much time and effort reviewing stuff on Amazon?&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;There\'s a pill called Suboxone that treats addiction to heroin and pain pills like oxycontin. Doctors and addicts say it\'s amazing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was the best thing that ever happened," one heroin addict told us. "I was like OH. MY. LORD. This is a miracle pill."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government spent tens of millions of dollars developing Suboxone. Doctors can prescribe it in their offices. But a lot of people who want it can\'t get it from a doctor, so they have to buy it on the street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today on the show: Why people have to turn to drug dealers to get a pill that fights addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This episode was originally posted last year. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more, see &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22256949" target="_blank"&gt;this paper on the history of Suboxone&lt;/a&gt;.

Great, we figure: This is the company that will sell you anything on the planet and get it you you the next day. And what we need in this case isn\'t even a &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt;, really.

ESPN alone is costing you more than $5 a month &amp;#8212; even if you never watch it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we answer the question every cable subscriber has asked: Why can\'t I just pay for the channels I want?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more on the cable business, see our post, &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/09/27/226499294/the-most-and-least-expensive-cable-channels-in-1-graph" target="_blank"&gt;The Most (And Least) Expensive Cable Channels, In 1 Graph&lt;/a&gt;, and Adam Davidson\'s column, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/09/magazine/the-mad-men-economic-miracle.html?_r=0" target="_blank"&gt;The \'Mad Men\' Economic Miracle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Music: Dinah Washington\'s "&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/T-V-The-Thing-This-Year/dp/B000VWOD00"&gt;T.V.

That\'s been the case for 130 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we visit the mill. We hear the story of the guy who jumped out a hotel window to win the government contract to print all that paper.

In other words, that\'s how many people are officially poor. But pretty much everyone who studies poverty agrees: The way we arrive at this figure is completely wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we figure out how we got here, why still measure poverty in a way that so many people agree is wrong, and how could we do it better.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;We\'re in a gym full of high school students. The gym is at the headquarters of the New York Federal Reserve, just a few blocks from Wall Street. The students are here for the High School Fed Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you\'re a high school student and you dream of holding the U.S. economy in the palm of your hand &amp;#8212; if you want the power to control interest rates and to print money out of thin air &amp;#8212; the Fed Challenge is for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we sit in on the finals &amp;#8212; and hear from a bunch of teenagers about what Fed policy means for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This episode was originally posted last year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Music: Fun.\'s "&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Are-Young-feat-Janelle-Mon%C3%A1e/dp/B005LAZP18/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1336526418&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank"&gt;We Are Young&lt;/a&gt;."

One giant company after another went bust or was rescued at the last minute, as the government launched a wave of bailouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another momentous thing happened five years ago this week: The Planet Money podcast came into being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we replay key moments from some of our first shows, when it seemed like the entire economy could seize up at any moment.

But what\'s shocking &amp;#8212; at least, it was shocking to us &amp;#8212; is just how big the gap can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;The most lucrative majors typically lead to jobs with salaries over $100,000 a year. The least lucrative lead to salaries of around $30,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we run the numbers. We talk to people who majored in the most- and least-lucrative subjects. And we hear from an economist who says, when it comes to income, choosing a major is more important than choosing a college.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we check in with our reporters in Bangladesh. We hear what it was like inside the factory where the Planet Money men\'s T-shirt was knit, dyed, cut and sewn. And we ask: Will Bangladesh be able to move beyond making T-shirts?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Music: Alex King\'s "&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sewing-Machine-Feat-Struggle-Explicit/dp/B0028D97JC" target="_blank"&gt;Like A Sewing Machine&lt;/a&gt;."

The park also sits on top of hundreds of millions of barrels of oil, worth billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government of Ecuador faces a choice: Should it protect the park, or go for the money?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until very recently, the country was trying to do both. The government said it would leave the rainforest untouched &amp;#8212; if rich countries gave billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We reported on the story earlier this year. Today, we find out how the story ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This is an update of an episode that was originally posted in February.

And, unlike today, a $1 bill wasn\'t always worth $1. Sometimes people took the bills at face value. Sometimes they accepted them at a discount (a $1 bill might only be worth 90 cents, say.) Sometimes people rejected certain bills altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we figure out how this world worked. And explain how the Civil War &amp;#8212; and the Union\'s need for money &amp;#8212; changed everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This episode was originally posted last year. Note #2: Starting next week, podcasts will be posted on Wednesday and Friday, rather than on Tuesday and Friday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;As the Egyptian military cracked down on protesters last week, U.S.-made Apache helicopters flew overhead. The Egyptian military also uses American made tanks, fighter jets and bullets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the product of the $1.3 billion in military aid the U.S. provides to Egypt every year. In polls, a majority of Egyptians say they want that aid to end. And it\'s become &lt;a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/08/18/mccain-u-s-has-no-credibility-in-egypt/" target="_blank"&gt;unpopular among some powerful Americans&lt;/a&gt; as well. Yet, so far, the aid hasn\'t stopped flowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show: Why it\'s so hard for the U.S. to stop sending military aid to Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we meet a woman who is trying to bring nuance and subtlety to a world of black-and-white rules: pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/emily.oster/papers/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Emily Oster&lt;/a&gt; is an economist and the author of a book called &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Expecting-Better-Conventional-Pregnancy-Wrong/dp/1594204756" target="_blank"&gt;Expecting Better&lt;/a&gt;. Like our own Chana Joffe-Walt &amp;#8212; who takes a break from maternity leave to host today\'s show &amp;#8212; Oster found herself confused and frustrated by all the rules of pregnancy. Unlike Chana, Emily Oster decided to read almost every study that had every been conducted on pregnancy and risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we talk to Oster about what she discovered. (Spoiler: A glass of wine is Ok.)&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://givedirectly.org/" target="_blank"&gt;GiveDirectly&lt;/a&gt; is a charity that just gives money to poor people. The people who get the money can spend it on whatever they want. They never have to pay it back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we hear from someone who got money from GiveDirectly, from one of the founder\'s of the group, and from a few other people in the charity world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, really, today\'s show is just a quick introduction. For the complete Planet Money experience, allow us to direct your attention to &lt;a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/503/i-was-just-trying-to-help" target="_blank"&gt;This American Life&lt;/a&gt;, where our full story about GiveDirectly is airing this weekend. For ways to listen, see This American Life\'s aptly named &lt;a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/listen/stations" target="_blank"&gt;Ways To Listen page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="en-US"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;" face="Times New Roman" size="3"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;" face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;On today&amp;#8217;s show, three stories about what how products and people get branded and what happens when you peel back the label, and try to get the full story. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;In most industries, competitors getting together to restrict the supply of a good would be illegal. But in the raisin world, it\'s the opposite. Competitors have to work together. They all decide as a group how many raisins to release to the public. What can get you in trouble in raisins, is going against that group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Raisin farmer, Marvin Horne, is a raisin rebel, a raisin outlaw. He refused to follow the rules of the Raisin Administrative Committee and found himself under surveillance by Rocky Pipkin\'s detective agency. Now he\'s being sued by the federal government for hundreds of thousands of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;On today\'s show, the upside-down world of raisins.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;More than half of all Japanese women quit their jobs after giving birth to their first child. That\'s more than double the rate in the U.S., and it\'s a problem for Japan\'s economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;If more women returned to the workforce, it would go a huge way toward boosting growth in the country and solving a big demographic problem &amp;#8212; not enough working people to support the nation\'s retirees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;But finding childcare in Japan is even harder than finding childcare in the U.S. The long-term solution is robot nannies. (Really.) On today\'s show: How Japanese working moms can survive until the robots arrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For More:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/07/19/203372076/will-robot-nannies-save-japans-economy" target="_blank"&gt;Will Robot Nannies Save Japan\'s Economy?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Everybody likes free. But free can be dangerous, too. Today\'s show is sort of the flip side free. It is what happens when you take something that was free &amp;#8212; and you give it a price, a decision many Internet companies face today. &lt;em&gt;That &lt;/em&gt;is a highly risky move, it turns out. And the damage can be enormous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, free of charge, Chana Joffe-Walt and Alex Blumberg tell the story of the Red Cross and free doughnuts &amp;#8212; that suddenly weren\'t free any more. It happened 70 years ago, and the Red Cross is still feeling the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***Note this episode originally aired in July 2012.***&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;*Not really. But sort of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we bring you three Planet Money radio stories, each of which looks at something indicator-ish:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;The Beige Book:&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/07/17/203032386/the-ask-your-uncle-approach-to-economics" target="_blank"&gt;The \'Ask Your Uncle\' Approach To Economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&amp;#160;&lt;/strong&gt;The price of gold:&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/07/26/205544156/what-a-falling-gold-price-means-for-pawn-shops" target="_blank"&gt;What A Falling Gold Price Means For Pawn Shops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;The price of a pedi-cab ride:&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/07/09/199048226/how-to-spend-442-on-a-15-minute-cab-ride" target="_blank"&gt;How To Spend $442 on a 15-minute cab ride&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we took a tour of Detroit with a local newspaper reporter and an urban planner. We go see what happened to all the big dreams Detroit has had over the years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;U.S. citizens who want to buy stuff from North Korea have to write a letter to the U.S. government asking for special permission. As regular listeners know, we\'re sort of obsessed with North Korea. So we decided to try to get those letters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several months ago, we filed a Freedom of Information Act request. It worked! We recently got a stack of heavily redacted letters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show: we try to figure out who sent the letters, why they wanted to do business with North Korea, and what that tells us about the North Korean economy.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On our show today, we tell you everything you need to know about the filibuster, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;What Schoolhouse Rock didn\'t tell us&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why Aaron Burr and Jimmy Stewart are the two great villains in filibuster history&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How Senators can now filibuster bills without having to talk for hours on end&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;*&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Today\'s show is a rerun.

But maybe it doesn\'t have to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we talk to a couple economists about a very simple idea that could solve the climate-change problem: Tax carbon emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;A carbon tax could be paired with cuts in the income tax. And it would drive down emissions without picking winners or losers, and without creating complicated regulations.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we talk to commodities traders to answer one of the most important questions in finance: What actually happens at the end of Trading Places?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know something crazy happens on the trading floor. We know that Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd get rich and the Duke brothers lose everything. But how does it all happen? And could it happen in the real world?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also on the show: The "Eddie Murphy Rule" that wound up in the the big financial overhaul law Congress passed in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today\'s special guest co-host is Roman Mars, host of 99% Invisible. &lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On today\'s Planet Money, we travel to a place where people are trying to live without government interference. A place where you can use bits of silver to buy uninspected bacon. A place where a 9-year-old will sell you alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s the Porcupine Freedom Festival, known to its friends as &lt;a href="http://porcfest.com//" target="_blank"&gt;PorcFest&lt;/a&gt;. It\'s the summer festival for people who think we should return to the gold standard and abolish the IRS.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On today\'s Planet Money, we travel to a place where people are trying to live without government interference.

This is a huge, little-discussed part of the post-crisis economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Almost everybody agrees that taxpayers shouldn\'t be on the hook when their neighbors don\'t pay their mortgages. But the government doesn\'t have a clear plan to get out of the mortgage business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Last week, two senators (a Republican and a Democrat)&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/senators-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-replace-fannie-freddie-with-new-agency/2013/06/25/c5437850-dd9e-11e2-b197-f248b21f94c4_story.html" target="_blank"&gt;introduced a bill&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;that would get rid of Fannie and Freddie and reduce the government\'s role in the mortgage business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we try to figure out what the new bill means. And&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/series/134930673/american-housing-the-story-of-fannie-and-freddie" target="_blank"&gt;we revisit the story of the rise of Fannie and Freddie&lt;/a&gt;, which we first talked about on the show a few years back.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On today\'s show: Two stories from Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Poachers kill rhinos for their horns. Some economists think legalizing the horns could save the rhinos. **Warning: this story contains graphic audio.**&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; . Getting clean water to people in the developing world isn\'t just an engineering problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;We live in a society full of people who are obsessed with making sure that prices are right and supply meets demand. And then there\'s the live-music business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Concert tickets are often too cheap, and the supply is too limited. Scalpers are the proof: If tickets were more expensive to begin with, or if venues were bigger, scalpers wouldn\'t be able to charge more than face value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we talk to Kid Rock about how he\'s trying to cut scalpers out of the business &amp;#8212; and still sell cheap tickets to his shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;For More: See Adam Davidson\'s New York Times Magazine column,&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/magazine/the-secret-science-of-scalping-tickets.html?pagewanted=all"&gt;How Much Is Michael Bolton Worth to You?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Read Josh Baron and Dean Budnick\'s book:&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ticket-Masters-Concert-Industry-Scalped/dp/1550229494"&gt;Ticket Masters: The Rise of the Concert Industry and How the Public Got Scalped&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;and economist Pascal Courty\'s many&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=pHGOE0MAAAAJ&amp;hl=en"&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;The price of tires has risen by about 40 percent in the past five years. That\'s partly because rubber prices have gone up. But it\'s also due to a tariff that the U.S. on Chinese tire imports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;As tire prices have risen, more people have been renting tires rather than buying them outright. And renting tires, it turns out, is often a bad deal in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show: How a celebrated attempt to help one group of people ended quietly hurting a much larger group. Also on the show:&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.titan-intl.com/management-team" target="_blank"&gt;The Grizz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Mike Smith lives by himself in a small house in a small town in Kentucky, near the Ohio River. He makes about $1,000 a month, owns his house outright, and doesn\'t carry any debt. He suspects that his brother and at least one but maybe all of his three grown children have stolen money from him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Over a period of about a year he made exactly six transactions that cost him over $100 &amp;#8212; a property tax bill, an insurance payment, a couple big-ticket repairs. And there was the $109 he spent on a pet lizard, which he planned to use as an investment by breeding it and selling its offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we look at how people create their own financial systems from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Mike has thousands of dollars stashed around his house in different "accounts." Tamara Bullock and Patricia Hamilton are part of an informal savings club. Miguel Rada has a whole bank in his pocket &amp;#8212; he takes deposits from some people and lends to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Mike\'s story comes to us via the&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.usfinancialdiaries.org/" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Financial Diaries Project&lt;/a&gt;. (His name isn\'t really Mike Smith, by the way; the project gave him a pseudonym so he could remain anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Thomas Peterffy\'s life story includes a typing robot, a proto-iPad, and a vast fortune he amassed as one of the first guys to use computers in financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, Peterffy tells us his story &amp;#8212; and he explains why he\'s worried about the financial world he helped create.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Also on the show: We talk with Simone Foxman of&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://qz.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Quartz&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;about high-speed traders&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://qz.com/92786/more-evidence-that-data-thomson-reuters-gives-its-clients-may-be-leaking-out-even-earlier-than-its-meant-to/" target="_blank"&gt;paying to get a key financial indicator&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;two seconds before everybody else.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;After decades of isolation, Myanmar is reconnecting with the rest of the world. On today\'s show, we meet two people who are trying to take advantage of the changes going on there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;One is launching a tiny startup. The other works for Coca-Cola &amp;#8212; a company that left Myanmar decades ago, and only returned to the country last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;For more, see our stories "&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/05/24/186275257/can-this-man-bring-silicon-valley-to-yangon" target="_blank"&gt;Can This Man Bring Silicon Valley To Yangon?&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/06/07/189184092/how-to-sell-coke-to-people-who-have-never-had-a-sip" target="_self"&gt;How To Sell Coke To People Who Have Never Had A Sip&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;*Note: The country is only getting richer on paper, but that change may make a difference in the real world.*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;People talk about GDP as if it means something solid, as if it\'s a mathematically derived and agreed upon fact. But in conversations we\'ve had in the last few weeks, we\'ve become more convinced that GDP is a wobbly fact. It\'s malleable, and it\'s mushy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;GDP can change in a day. And when it does &amp;#8212; even when it\'s a statistical illusion &amp;#8212; that illusion can still have a major impact on millions of lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, Nigeria is about to change the way it calculates its GDP. The change will likely make Nigeria the leading economy in Africa, and it could be a big boost for the Nigerian entrepreneurs behind Pledge 51, a mobile app company based in Lagos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;The guys behind Pledge 51 have found success with mobile apps like Danfo, a game which lets players pretend to drive the notoriously wild buses in Lagos. But to take their company to the next level, they want foreign investment. A boost to their country\'s GDP could bring in exactly the type of foreign investors they are hoping for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: A previous version of this show incorrectly stated that the World Bank lends out $35 million a year. The correct number is $35 billion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;It\'s something you can see on every block in most major cities. You probably see it every day and never give a second thought to. But in Yangon, Myanmar, an ATM is a small miracle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;For decades, Myanmar was cut off from the rest of the world. There were international sanctions, and no one in the U.S. or Europe did business there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;But last year, when the international sanctions started to be lifted, companies like Visa and Mastercard were excited to come in. The country has about 50 million people &amp;#8212; that\'s a lot of potential customers to pay ATM fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Setting up these machines has been a technological challenge because of the country\'s aging infrastructure. But there is a bigger problem with ATMs here that a lot of the international companies weren\'t expecting. The people in Myanmar are reluctant to use ATMs because they don\'t trust the banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;"The banks don\'t work very well," says Zeya Thu, a journalist. " Sometimes you have to bribe the staff to get your money back. So people put their money under their mattresses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Thu is a business columnist, but even he keeps his life savings at home, out of the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, how do you get a country to join the world economy when the people there don\'t even trust their own banks.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Back in the nineties, Jim Logan started a company called Personal Audio. The concept was simple &amp;#8212; people could pick out magazine articles they liked on the internet, and his company would send them a cassette tape of those articles being read out loud. The cassette tapes didn\'t catch on like Jim hoped, but he had bigger dreams for the idea behind them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He dreamed that one day you wouldn\'t need a cassette player, you would just be able to hear smart people talking about whatever subject you wanted, and that audio would be magically downloaded to a device of your choice. He says he dreamed of podcasting as we know it today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Jim Logan did not create the technology to podcast. He himself is not a modern-day podcaster. But he did get a patent on that big dream of downloading personalized audio, and he claims to have the patent on podcasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, he says all the people out there podcasting today, owe him money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more&lt;/strong&gt;, check out Alex Blumberg and Laura Sydell\'s story on this weekend\'s This American Life :&lt;a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/496/when-patents-attackpart-two"&gt;When Patents Attack...Part Two!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On today\'s show: Three short stories from the far flung shores of New Zealand, Ireland and New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First up, it\'s no secret that some Americans hide money offshore to avoid paying U.S. taxes. Over the past decade, some 39,000 people have come forward voluntarily to tell the IRS about their offshore money. This group provides a small window into the world of people who are hiding money in offshore havens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also: how a single page in a report written decades ago by U.S. consultants, and funded by the U.S. State Department, brought Apple to Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s Planet Money, we meet a single mother who makes $16,000 a year &amp;#8212; and who managed to fund a vacation at a Caribbean resort with an interest-free loan from one of the world\'s largest banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Edith Calzado gets credit cards with teaser zero-percent interest rates &amp;#8212; then transfers her balance before the rate ticks up. She signs up for store cards to get discounts &amp;#8212; then pays off her bill on time. She gets food stamps and lives in subsidized housing. Her son is doing well in school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;She may be the single most successful and productive beneficiary of government assistance you\'ll ever meet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This podcast was originally posted in 2010.&amp;#160;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;In 2010,&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2010/06/10/127750586/how-foreign-aid-is-hurting-haitian-farmers" target="_blank"&gt;we reported on a poor town in Haiti&lt;/a&gt;, where school was held in a small, one-room church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Planet Money listeners were moved to donate some $3,000, which the principal of the school thought would be enough to build a school. A few months later, the money was gone, and all there was to show for it was&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2010/11/30/131705055/the-tuesday-podcast-what-your-3-000-bought-in-haiti" target="_blank"&gt;a foundation, some concrete blocks and some rock and sand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;We thought that would be the end of it. Then we heard from Tim Myers, a retired contractor from Colorado who decided to go to Haiti to build the school &amp;#8212; and who realized, in 2011, that&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/08/09/139237936/new-estimate-to-build-a-school-in-haiti-143-900" target="_blank"&gt;the project would cost more than $100,000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show: We return to Haiti, to see how the project is going.

We decided a few months ago to work with Jockey to make our t-shirts. Our women\'s shirt will be made in Colombia. Our men\'s shirt will be made, in part, in Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;But horrifying news has been coming out of Bangladesh\'s apparel industry recently. A garment factory collapsed a few weeks ago, killing more than 1,000 people. Last year, a factory fire killed hundreds of workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;As part of the t-shirt project, we\'ll be traveling to Bangladesh to report on the industry. On today\'s show, we start to ask: Is buying a t-shirt from Bangladesh a good thing or a bad thing for the people of Bangladesh?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more&lt;/strong&gt;: See Adam Davidson\'s latest New York Times Magazine column,&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/19/magazine/economic-recovery-made-in-bangladesh.html?ref=itstheeconomy&amp;_r=0" target="_blank"&gt;Economic Recovery, Made in Bangladesh?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;We\'re making a&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/planetmoney/planet-money-t-shirt"&gt;t-shirt&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;that tells the story of its own creation. Part of that story &amp;#8212; color. It took long meetings, late nights and endless discussion to choose the exact hues for our Planet Money t-shirt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we\'ll explain what the color of our women\'s t-shirt has to do with this&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/resource/10029/tahkt-i-sulayman-variation-ii"&gt;painting&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;from 1976, and we\'ll tell you how unfinished buildings halfway around the world are shaping what we see on store shelves right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You only have three days left to get your very own Planet Money t-shirt.

As it turns out, this has profound economic consequences for dealers all across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we meet a wholesaler who moves weed across the country, a California weed dealer seeking higher profits in New York, and a special agent who may be inadvertently helping the dealer out by trying to put him in jail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For More: See &lt;a href="http://www.wnyc.org/articles/wnyc-news/2013/may/06/weed-trail-californias-medical-market-new-yorks-underground/" target="_blank"&gt;The Weed Trail&lt;/a&gt;, from WNYC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we meet a Brazilian who took on the world\'s largest superpower; a Texas cotton farmer who\'s tired of hearing the Brazilians complain; and a guy named Renato &amp;#8212; a.k.a. Retaliation Master.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we hear why U.S. taxpayers are paying Brazilian cotton growers nearly $150 million a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This show originally ran in 2011, near the beginning of our quest to make a Planet Money t-shirt. We\'re re-playing it now because we just re-launched the t-shirt project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want a Planet Money t-shirt, &lt;a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/planetmoney/planet-money-t-shirt" target="_blank"&gt;visit our Kickstarter page&lt;/a&gt;.

And, perhaps inevitably, we hear from Washington, where the fight over sugar has been playing out for years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;For more, read &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/"&gt;our post from earlier today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/npr-planet-money-podcast/id290783428"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/npr-planet-money-podcast/id290783428"&gt;Subscribe to the podcast&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160; Find us &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/planetmoney"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/planetmoney"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/planetmoney/"&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;What causes what?

Therefore, my lucky hat caused my team to win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show we dive deep into the world of correlation and causation with Charles Wheelan, author of the new book, Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data. &lt;!--if gte mso 9]&gt;&lt;xml&gt; &lt;w:WordDocument&gt;  &lt;w:View&gt;Normal&lt;/w:View&gt;  &lt;w:Zoom&gt;0&lt;/w:Zoom&gt;  &lt;w:PunctuationKerning/&gt;  &lt;w:ValidateAgainstSchemas/&gt;  &lt;w:SaveIfXMLInvalid&gt;false&lt;/w:SaveIfXMLInvalid&gt;  &lt;w:IgnoreMixedContent&gt;false&lt;/w:IgnoreMixedContent&gt;  &lt;w:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText&gt;false&lt;/w:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText&gt;  &lt;w:Compatibility&gt;   &lt;w:BreakWrappedTables/&gt;   &lt;w:SnapToGridInCell/&gt;   &lt;w:WrapTextWithPunct/&gt;   &lt;w:UseAsianBreakRules/&gt;   &lt;w:DontGrowAutofit/&gt;  &lt;/w:Compatibility&gt;  &lt;w:BrowserLevel&gt;MicrosoftInternetExplorer4&lt;/w:BrowserLevel&gt; &lt;/w:WordDocument&gt;&lt;/xml&gt;&lt;!endif]--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--if gte mso 9]&gt;&lt;xml&gt; &lt;w:LatentStyles DefLockedState="false" LatentStyleCount="156"&gt; &lt;/w:LatentStyles&gt;&lt;/xml&gt;&lt;!endif]--&gt;&lt;!--if gte mso 10]&gt;&lt;style&gt; /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable{mso-style-name:"Table Normal";mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0;mso-tstyle-colband-size:0;mso-style-noshow:yes;mso-style-parent:"";mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;mso-para-margin:0in;mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt;mso-pagination:widow-orphan;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-ansi-language:#0400;mso-fareast-language:#0400;mso-bidi-language:#0400;}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;!endif]--&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-weight: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 class="parseasinTitle "&gt;&lt;span id="btAsinTitle"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Three years ago, Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff published a study that quickly became one of the most famous, most talked about economics papers since the financial crisis. It got so much attention because it answered a basic question everybody was asking: How much debt is too much?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Reinhart and Rogoff looked at what had happened in many different countries over many years. And they found a what looked like a clear debt threshold: 90 percent. Average growth was much, much slower in countries with debt-to-gdp ratios over 90 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;The paper got a lot of coverage in the press. Politicians cited it in the U.S. and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Then, this week, a 28-year-old grad student and his professors published a startling finding: Reinhart and Rogoff had made a simple Excel error in one part of their study. The authors of the new critique also questioned other elements of the study and argued that, in fact, there is no debt threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we hear from the grad student who found the error. And we ask: How much should we trust economics?&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 8.333000183105469%; margin-bottom: 1.3em; margin-left: auto; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 15px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 15px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; font-size: 1.6rem; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; float: none; position: static; min-height: 1px; width: 690px; line-height: 1.5; color: #111111; max-width: 690px; border-width: 0px;"&gt;The U.S. has a really conflicted history with the income tax. For most of American history, there was no income tax at all. At one point it was ruled unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 8.333000183105469%; margin-bottom: 1.3em; margin-left: auto; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 15px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 15px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; font-size: 1.6rem; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; float: none; position: static; min-height: 1px; width: 690px; line-height: 1.5; color: #111111; max-width: 690px; border-width: 0px;"&gt;Today, income tax is the federal government\'s main source of revenue.

Note: This podcast was originally published last year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Last year, a federal program took about $60 billion from wealthier Americans and gave it to the working poor. This program &amp;#8212; a massive redistribution of wealth --has been embraced by every president from Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we look at a huge, often overlooked, surprisingly interesting corner of the tax code: The Earned Income Tax Credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;For more, see our story&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/03/15/174358638/a-surprisingly-uncontroversial-program-that-gives-money-to-poor-people" target="_blank"&gt;A Surprisingly Uncontroversial Program That Gives Money To Poor People&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Since the start of the year, the Japanese yen has risen by about 12 percent against the dollar. The euro has fallen by about 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Then there\'s bitcoin, a virtual currency that doesn\'t even exist in the physical world. In the past few months, the value of bitcoin has risen by more than 1,000 percent &amp;#8212; from less than $20 per bitcoin a few months ago to more than $200 today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we ask: Is a skyrocketing value a good thing or a bad thing for bitcoin?&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;We have secondary markets for almost everything. If you no longer want that old record or CD, you can sell it to a thrift store, used record store, or on Craigslist or eBay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;But what about songs from your iTunes library you no longer want?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Today on the show, the story of a company that tried to set up an online marketplace where people can buy and sell old mp3s, and what happened to them.

One area hit particularly hard was Coney Island, an iconic New York beach at the tip of South Brooklyn. At the time, we&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/11/02/164207529/coney-island-devastated-by-superstorm-sandy"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;on the damage to a family-owned amusement park,&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.wonderwheel.com/"&gt;Deno\'s Wonderwheel Amusement Park&lt;/a&gt;, home to the Wonder Wheel, bumper cars, and the Spook-A-Rama. We reported that the place was basically doomed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;But it turns out, our report was a kind of premature obituary for the business. We return to the amusement park, about 5 months after the storm, and find things shockingly normal. Businesses like Deno\'s are back and some of them are thriving. On today\'s show, an economic case study. What brought Coney Island back so quickly?&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This podcast was originally published in 2011. With North Korea&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/search/index.php?searchinput=north+korea" target="_blank"&gt;in the news&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;again this week, we\'re re-running it today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;North Korea relies on charity to feed its starving people. But the country\'s elites like their luxuries &amp;#8212; imported wine, fine china, dancing shoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;To buy those things, they need foreign currency. (North Korean currency is worthless outside of North Korea.) To get foreign currency, they need to sell things to the outside world. But North Korea\'s industrial base is a disaster, and the country doesn\'t grow enough food to feed itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s Planet Money, we look at the ways North Korea\'s leaders have managed to keep foreign currency flowing into the country. Their strategies include manufacturing drugs, counterfeiting U.S. dollars, and selling gigantic statues to foreign leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;For more at&amp;#160;www.npr.org/money.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;A few years back, the Kenyan government wanted to encourage exports. So the government said to local businesses: For every $100 of stuff you sell to someone outside Kenya, we\'ll give you Kenyan shillings worth another $20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;A con artist saw an opportunity. He launched a company that exported nonexistent gold for nonexistent dollars, and collected a real government bonus. Then, when he was about to get caught, he started his own bank. That\'s when the scam really took off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show: How one guy pulled off one of the largest financial scams in Kenyan history, avoided prison, re-branded himself as a man of God, and ran for a seat in parliament.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;We\'re an economics show. We cover the economy. But it\'s come to our attention that, until now, we\'ve missed one of the biggest stories in our economy: The startling rise in the number of people on federal disability programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;It\'s the story of 14 million people who don\'t show up in most of the numbers we look at to understand the economy. These 14 million Americans don\'t have jobs, but they don\'t show up in any of the unemployment measures that we use. They receive federal assistance, but are often overlooked in discussions of the social safety net.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show: What disability in America says about the state of the American workforce, and about what it means to be poor in America nearly 20 years after we ended welfare as we knew it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For much, much more on disability&lt;/strong&gt;, see our&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://apps.npr.org/unfit-for-work/" target="_blank"&gt;giant online story&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;and listen to&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/490/trends-with-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;This American Life this weekend&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;(we\'re doing the whole hour on disability).

His name is Tim Penny and not Tim Perry.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;We\'ll be honest: We thought we were through with the crisis in Europe, at least for a while. The continent seemed to be muddling though just fine. So we shut down our hotline to the European Central Bank and boxed up our copies of the Masstrict treaty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;But this weekend, we woke up to find we were wrong. Late night foreign minister meetings, lines at the ATMs, protests in the street &amp;#8212; it\'s all back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;The crisis has emerged again in an unlikely place. On today\'s show: Why did the world freak out over the Cyprus bailout?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;For more about this episode, visit the Planet Money &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/03/19/174766799/episode-445-cyprus-takes-away-the-security-blanket" target="_blank"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Sometimes your success depends on how your competitors behave.

If you adjust for inflation, the highs just aren\'t as high as they seem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;And even if we do hit a real, inflation-adjusted high in the next few weeks, it won\'t mean much.

There are thousands of Amish run firms out there making everything from plumbing supplies to furniture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;But running an Amish business poses unique challenges. Many Amish don\'t connect to the electrical grid. They don\'t drive cars. They prize modesty, meaning traditional advertising slogans like "best," "fastest," and "greatest" are out. An Amish company has to be creative about these things. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;And, the Amish have tricks they can teach the rest of the business world. For one, they have perfected the art of marketing to a niche audience. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;On today\'s show, we travel to the The Buckeye Tool Expo in Dalton, Ohio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;#160;to see how the Amish balance their business interests with their personal beliefs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;The Catholic Church is not a corporation. It\'s a religion, a cultural force, and a global power. Still, one of the things the new Pope will have to deal with is a classic business mess &amp;#8212; a multi-billion dollar conglomerate that has stumbled and is losing money and relevance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, experts (including a priest with a Harvard MBA) tell us what the church needs to do to turn things around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;em style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #111111; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 24px;"&gt;Music: &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pipe-Organ-Hymns/dp/B0029B7TI4"&gt;Faithful Father\'s Pipe Organ Hymns&lt;/a&gt;, &amp; Run DMC\'s "&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Down-With-King-Run-Dmc/dp/B00000J7IZ"&gt;Down With The King&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;em style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #111111; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 24px;"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em style="font-size: 14px; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #111111; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 24px;"&gt;Find us:&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/planetmoney" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 16px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #4774cc; text-decoration: none; line-height: inherit;"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;/&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php?ref=home#%21/planetmoney?ref=ts" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 16px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #4774cc; text-decoration: none; line-height: inherit;"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;/&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/jjiang/playlist/1G4vLCsLkm3ZOv7P0S05K6" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 16px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #4774cc; text-decoration: none; line-height: inherit;"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://planetmoney.tumblr.com/" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 16px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #4774cc; text-decoration: none; line-height: inherit;"&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;em style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Download the Planet Money&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/planet-money/id529827672?mt=8" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 16px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #4774cc; text-decoration: none; line-height: inherit;"&gt;iPhone App&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;If you have good health insurance, you\'ve probably never even seen a full hospital bill.

But how do you measure happiness?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Ecuador\'s Yasuni National Park is an amazing rainforest &amp;#8212; home to jaguars, giant otters, the golden-mantled tamarin and woolly monkeys. The park also sits on top of hundreds of millions of barrels of oil, worth billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;The government of Ecuador faces a choice: Should it protect the park, or go for the money?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;The country is trying to do both. The government says it will promise to leave its rainforest untouched &amp;#8212; if rich counties give Ecuador billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;In the spring of 2011, voters an Iceland had to decide whether to pick up the tab for mistakes bankers made before the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We visited Iceland just before the vote and met Hei&amp;#240;a D&amp;#243;ra J&amp;#243;nsd&amp;#243;ttir, a 29-year-old new mom. Hei&amp;#240;a was trying to figure out how to vote so we set up interviews for her with a bunch of experts on the subject, including Iceland\'s president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hei&amp;#240;a and the majority of Icelanders eventually voted "no" on the referendum, but the fight didn\'t end there. The British and Dutch governments took Iceland to court to try to recover money their citizens lost when an Icelandic bank failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show: we revisit that story from 2011 and give an update on how the years-long, international, multi-billion-dollar battle turned out.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;The Affordable Care Act &amp;#8212; aka Obamacare &amp;#8212; requires health insurers to pay for breast pumps. For many insurance plans, the new rule kicked in at the start of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we visit a breast pump boutique that has suddenly become a medical supply superstore. And we look at happens when a device goes from being something people have to pay for out of their own pocket to being free for anyone with insurance.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This is an updated version of a podcast that originally aired in Dec., 2011.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you\'re looking for the beginning &amp;#8212; and, possibly, the end &amp;#8212; of the European financial crisis, you can find it in a single building: The Greek statistics office, at 46 Peireos Street in Athens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We visited recently and found what may be the world\'s most high-stakes game of office politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one side: The technocrats, led by Andreas Georgiou, who was appointed last year to run the office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other : The old guard, including Konstantinos Skordas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Georgiou\'s technocratic ways &amp;#8212; like reporting Greek deficit figures directly to European authorities &amp;#8212; have landed him in hot water with the old guard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His email was hacked, he says. His workers went out on strike.

How am I supposed to make my famous kiddie pool paella?!?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;The most mysterious thing about this shortage of rice: There was more than enough to go around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;It is the epic story of a shortage that wasn\'t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;In this global caper of good intentions gone wrong, there are shadowy trade deals, corrupt government officials, and warehouses full of rice in a country that didn\'t want it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Today\'s show is a rerun. It originally ran on&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/11/04/142016962/the-friday-podcast-how-fear-turned-a-surplus-into-scarcity" target="_blank"&gt;November, 2010&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.herbalife.com/global" target="_blank"&gt;Herbalife&lt;/a&gt;, a company that sells weight loss shakes, vitamins and other similar products, is worth billions of dollars. The company has been around for more than 30 years, and it\'s traded on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Ackman thinks the whole thing is a pyramid scheme.Not surprisingly, Herbalife disagrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ackman manages a hedge fund that has shorted more than a billion dollars\' worth of Herbalife stock. If the stock falls &amp;#8212; and Ackman says he thinks it will fall all the way to zero &amp;#8212; the fund will make money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we talk to Ackman and to Herbalife. And we consider what it means when an investor bets that a company will fail.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Chances are you\'ve received an email with a subject line like this: "The hottest method to please your beloved one." Or this: "Want to get good health for low prices?" Or emails offering "low cost med pills!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;You\'ve probably wondered &amp;#8212; who is sending these emails? Does anyone actually click on these links? What happens when they do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show &amp;#8212; we go deep inside the world of spam to answer these questions with the help of cyber-security reporter&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/category/pharma-wars/"&gt;Brian Krebs&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;and researcher&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/%7Esavage/" target="_blank"&gt;Stefan Savage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On today\'s show: Three short stories about the stuff we buy &amp;#8212; books, toys and clothes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/12/27/168098756/are-e-books-actually-destroying-traditional-publishing"&gt;Are E-Books Actually Destroying Traditional Publishing? &lt;/a&gt;Conventional wisdom says e-books are destroying the traditional publishing business model. People pay less for e-books and that drives down price. When you talk to publishers though, you realize the story\'s not that simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/12/13/167055503/why-legos-are-so-expensive-and-so-popular"&gt;Why Legos Are So Expensive &amp;#8212; And So Popular&lt;/a&gt; Legos often cost twice as much as similar blocks from a rival toymaker. So why are Legos so much more popular than other brands?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/01/04/168627298/3-d-printing-is-kind-of-a-big-deal"&gt;3-D Printing Is (Kind Of) A Big Deal&lt;/a&gt; It\'s miraculous to see: Press a button, make anything you want. But will it transform the economy?&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Williston, North Dakota is in the middle of an oil boom. Thousands of workers have flooded into the town, but they\'re reluctant to call it home. Instead, they live in bleak rentals, often sleeping in dormitory-like rooms known as "man camps."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Local officials are trying to turn Williston into a real town, where people want to bring their families. But it\'s a tough sell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we visit Williston, and we learn why one guy endures a thousand-mile commute, why a one-bedroom apartment costs $2100 a month, and why the town is building an indoor lazy river.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;LeBron James, the best basketball player in the NBA, makes $17.5 million a year. And he is the most underpaid professional athlete in the world today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we explain why LeBron is getting hosed &amp;#8212; and why that\'s probably a good thing for NBA fans, team owners, other pro players, and even LeBron himself.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;You would never look at a&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=210862890723521933918.0004aa199afc0c9981e5c&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=41.071069,-73.891296&amp;spn=0.310076,0.441513" target="_blank"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;of the Hudson River, point to the spot where the Tappan Zee Bridge is, and say, "Put the bridge here!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;The Tappan Zee crosses one of the widest points on the Hudson &amp;#8212; the bridge is more than three miles long. And if you go just a few miles south, the river gets much narrower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Our question for today\'s show: Why did they build a three-mile-long bridge when they could have built a much shorter, cheaper bridge nearby?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Our search for an answer leads us to a forensic engineer, the Statue of Liberty, and a governor who wanted to be an opera singer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This episode was originally released in&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/08/09/139276566/the-tuesday-podcast-a-big-bridge-in-the-wrong-place" target="_blank"&gt;August, 2011&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we take a page from radio newscaster &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=101315590"&gt;Paul Harvey&lt;/a&gt; and tell you "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YSkEfwFQ2U"&gt;the rest of the story&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We look back at the stories we\'ve done in 2012 and tell you what we got right, what we got wrong and how everything turned out in Belize. Plus, we try to to figure out whether that Facebook ad did anything to help Pizza Delicious.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Gift-giving &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2009/11/podcast_happy_efficent_holiday.html" target="_blank"&gt;makes economists crazy&lt;/a&gt;. It\'s so inefficient!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we wondered: Is there a way to make the holiday season both more efficient and more joyful?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s Planet Money, we try to answer that question by conducting a wildly unscientific experiment. We go into a seventh-grade classroom and give a bunch of kids some small gifts &amp;#8212; candy, raisins, fig newtons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then we ask them how much they value what they got, and if they can think of a way to make everyone better off, without buying any more gifts. They quickly arrive at a solution: trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behold, the power of economics!&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;The&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/12/20/167739912/fiscal-cliff-negotiations-settle-back-into-standstill"&gt;fiscal cliff&lt;/a&gt;, for all its grand theater, really comes down to people in a room trying to come to an agreement. People doing whatever it takes to get what they want from the other side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, three professional negotiators walk us through techniques that members of Congress may be using right now. They explain these techniques not with textbooks, but with examples from their everyday lives.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we visit Fire Station Six in Contra Costa County, Calif.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Firefighters don\'t go to fires as much as much as they used to. That\'s because, thanks to modern building codes, fires are not as common as they used to be. Yet the fire dept is still set up the same way: big trucks, lots of fire stations, and lots of firefighters who retire with lifetime pensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Rather than close fire stations, the firefighters in Contra Costa County agreed to take a pay cut a few years back. But the county still couldn\'t afford the fire department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;So the firefighters came up with a new plan: Ask the local citizens to support the fire department by paying higher taxes.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show: Three Planet Money stories that aired on the radio but haven\'t yet made it into the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/12/13/167089673/will-a-1-9-billion-settlement-be-enough-to-change-banks-behavior"&gt;Will A $1.9 Billion Settlement Change Banks\' Behavior?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/12/07/166682253/why-the-falling-birth-rate-is-bad-news-for-my-2-year-old-son"&gt;Why The Falling Birthrate Is Bad News For My 2-Year-Old Son&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/11/29/166093301/a-huge-pay-cut-for-doctors-is-hiding-in-the-fiscal-cliff"&gt;A Huge Pay Cut For Doctors Is Hiding In The Fiscal Cliff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On our show today, we tell you everything you need to know about the filibuster, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;What Schoolhouse Rock didn\'t tell us&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why Aaron Burr and Jimmy Stewart are the two great villains in filibuster history&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How Senators can now filibuster bills without having to talk for hours on end&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Before the Civil War, there were 8,000 different kinds of money in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Banks printed their own paper money. And, unlike today, a $1 bill wasn\'t always worth $1. Sometimes people took the bills at face value. Sometimes they accepted them at a discount (a $1 bill might only be worth 90 cents, say.) Sometimes people rejected certain bills altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we figure out how this world worked. And explain how the Civil War &amp;#8212; and the Union\'s need for money &amp;#8212; changed everything.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Last month, two states voted to legalize recreational marijuana. A bunch of others states have already legalized medical marijuana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Not surprisingly, there are legitimate, legal (at least under state law) marijuana entrepreneurs trying to start businesses around the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we discover the one big thing that\'s standing in their way: getting a bank account. And we learn how hard it is to run a business on cash alone.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This week\'s &lt;a href="http://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=312621" target="_blank"&gt;Congressional hearing on dollar coins&lt;/a&gt; prompted us to re-run this episode today. It originally ran in April of this year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legislation in Congress would get rid of dollar bills and replace them with coins. Proponents say coins are easier to use and save the country money in the long run. The bill people say none of this is true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So should we kill the dollar bill?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show we go deep into the nature of money itself, and we find a clear answer to this question.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show: Four Planet Money stories that aired on the radio but haven\'t yet made it into the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;*&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/11/17/165285719/a-sequester-is-a-jelly-like-mass-and-other-notes-on-fiscal-cliff-jargon" target="_blank"&gt;A Sequester Is A \'Jelly-Like Mass,\' And Other Notes On Fiscal-Cliff Jargon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;*&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/11/09/164742426/the-secret-genius-of-taylor-swift" target="_blank"&gt;Clear The Secret Genius Of Taylor Swift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;*&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/09/28/161962626/the-weird-story-of-why-helium-prices-are-going-through-the-roof" target="_blank"&gt;The Weird Story Of Why Helium Prices Are Going Through The Roof&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;*&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/10/26/163637629/energy-independence-wouldnt-make-gasoline-any-cheaper" target="_blank"&gt;Energy Independence Wouldn\'t Make Gasoline Any Cheaper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;One day in the early 1990s, a man walked into the U.S. embassy in Ecuador. He said he had information somebody would want to hear &amp;#8212; information on how to go after some of the most powerful drug traffickers in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man worked as a money changer. He said he was getting a lot of requests from traffickers who had a problem: They had so much cash that they didn\'t know what to do with it. They couldn\'t figure out how to launder their money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What they needed was an offshore bank to help them. On today\'s show, we hear how two U.S. agents &amp;#8212; one IRS, one DEA &amp;#8212; created a fake offshore bank to catch drug traffickers.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we consider a world where everybody cheats and where you can\'t win unless you game the regulators: Professional cycling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Under the leadership of Lance Armstrong, the U.S. Postal Service cycling team was wildly successful, winning the Tour de France seven years in a row.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;According to a recent&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://d3epuodzu3wuis.cloudfront.net/ReasonedDecision.pdf"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, the team was running a high-tech, secret doping operation during those years. The operation was run like a business, and its leader was Lance Armstrong.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Prices go up. Occasionally, prices go down. But for 70 years, the price of a bottle of Coca-Cola didn\'t change. From 1886 until the late 1950s, a bottle of Coke cost a nickel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we find out why. The answer includes a half a million vending machines, a 7.5 cent coin, and a company president who just wanted to get a couple lawyers out of his office.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Today\'s show is the story of two men and one big idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;The big idea is that a poor country should take a small, empty part of its territory and say: We\'re going to build a new city here. And in this new city, we\'re going to get rid of our existing laws and rules, and bring in the best laws we can find from around the world. Get help from foreign countries. Maybe the UK could serve as a court of appeals. Maybe Canada could send in a few Mounties to help set up a police force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;The two men are Paul Romer, a world famous North American economist, and Octavio Sanchez, chief of staff to the president of Honduras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;They think their big idea could be the answer to one of the oldest, hardest problems in economics: How do poor countries get richer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;And they seem like a perfect match. Paul is a famous economist who can sell the idea around the world. Octavio has the ear of the president in a poor country looking for a change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On the show, we find out what happens when they try to make their idea a reality.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Why do businesses selling the same thing crowd around each other rather than strike out on their own?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To answer that question, Adam Davidson and Chana Joffe-Walt walk through some New York City neighborhoods &amp;#8211; the diamond district, the plant district, the chess district &amp;#8212; where store after store sells the exact same thing.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;A monster storm flooded parts of the biggest city in America this week. Millions of people are still without power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;But in the long run &amp;#8212; even in the medium run &amp;#8212; New York (and New Jersey!) will recover. And for the U.S. economy as a whole, this disaster will barely be a blip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;This is largely because there are countless backup plans hiding everywhere in our economy. On today\'s show, a flooded grocery store reveals safety nets that are usually hidden but, at moments like these, are suddenly made visible.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;You rarely see lard on menus. There aren\'t shelves and shelves of it in every supermarket. In this country, we\'ve sort of lost touch with the once beloved pig fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s podcast, we ask &amp;#8212; who killed lard? Was it Upton Sinclair? His novel, &lt;em&gt;The Jungle&lt;/em&gt;, contained this memorable passage about the men who cook the lard:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;...and as for the other men, who worked in tank rooms full of steam, and in some of which there were open vats near the level of the floor, their peculiar trouble was that they fell into the vats; and when they were fished out, there was never enough of them left to be worth exhibiting,&amp;#8212; sometimes they would be overlooked for days, till all but the bones of them had gone out to the world as Durham\'s Pure Leaf Lard!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Or should we blame William Procter and James Gamble? It was their company which created a new alternative to lard &amp;#8212; the "pure and wholesome" Crisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Today\'s podcast is a rerun. It first ran in&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/01/06/144806987/the-friday-podcast-who-killed-lard" target="_blank"&gt;January, 2012&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;For months now, we\'ve been creating a fake presidential candidate based on the best ideas economics has to offer. We &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/07/18/156928675/episode-387-the-no-brainer-economic-platform" target="_blank"&gt;came up with a platform&lt;/a&gt;, with the help of a panel of economists. We &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/09/14/161165345/episode-402-free-heroin-and-other-ideas-that-wont-get-you-elected" target="_blank"&gt;hashed out the disagreement&lt;/a&gt; among the panel. We &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/09/28/161967973/episode-406-making-economics-sexy" target="_blank"&gt;brought in political consultants&lt;/a&gt; who laughed at us, but also gave us some great messaging ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we take it to the people &amp;#8212; or, at least, a focus group. We find out whether these economically sound ideas can get anyone\'s vote. And we create a couple real ads for our fake candidate.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Two big patent cases this summer in the smartphone industry:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. A jury finds that Samsung violated Apple\'s patents, and orders Samsung to pay Apple $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. A judge throws out a case between Apple and Motorola (now owned by Google). The judge goes on to write an &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCEQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fbusiness%2Farchive%2F2012%2F07%2Fwhy-there-are-too-many-patents-in-america%2F259725%2F&amp;ei=QeeGUIaSKLS80QG9_4DIDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNGJvOpJjEvjaFIycBWO0ul4lIaOVA" target="_blank"&gt;article in the Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; arguing that there are too many patents in America, and lots of industries could probably get along fine with no patents at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These radically different rulings were just the latest reminder that the world of software patents is a mess. Big companies that should be focused on inventing the next great thing are instead spending billions of dollars buying up patents and suing each other. Small companies have to worry that someone with some random patent is going to sue them and shut them down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we talk with &lt;a href="http://www.law.stanford.edu/node/166497" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lemley&lt;/a&gt;, who has some ideas for fixing the patent mess. Lemley is a professor at Stanford law school and an expert on software patents. Lemley also works for clients in the private sector, including Google.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we meet a self-described robber baron who decided to spend his billions on finger paint and changing tables. We revisit decades-long studies that found preschool made a huge difference in the lives of poor children. And we talk to a&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2000/heckman-lecture.html" target="_blank"&gt;Nobel prize-winning economist&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;who says that spending public money on preschool produces a huge return on investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;We\'ll have more on preschool this weekend on&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/" target="_blank"&gt;This American Life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;America used to lead the world in making cars. Now we don\'t. China does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used to be the number one maker of steel. American steel built bridges and ships all over the world. Not anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the world\'s most popular music still comes from American artists. Turn on a car radio in Italy, walk into a store in Mozambique, and there\'s a good chance you\'ll hear an American pop tune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music is an export, just like anything else. And, as with other exports, businesses in lots of other countries are fighting for their share of the global market. They want people all around to world to be listening to their music. And they\'re figuring out how to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The popularity of PSY\'s song "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0"&gt;Gangnam Style&lt;/a&gt;" is not a fluke. Korea has spent the last twenty years preparing for this moment.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Loyal Planet Money listeners may remember Willow Tufano, the Florida teenager who bought a house. We did a&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/03/20/149013540/the-tuesday-podcast-the-14-year-old-who-bought-a-house" target="_blank"&gt;show about her&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;back in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we follow up with Willow. She just bought another house. She\'s trying to land a reality TV deal. And she recently wore a Pikachu costume on a trip to Alabama.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Earlier this summer, we &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/07/27/157499893/episode-390-we-set-up-an-offshore-company-in-a-tax-haven" target="_blank"&gt;set up two shell companies&lt;/a&gt; in tax havens. On today\'s show, we continue our quest to figure out what people actually do with shell companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discover the world of "Asset Protection," which is a fancy way of saying "hiding money." It\'s a world of Latvian companies and offshore conferences, of people trying to hide money from their future-ex-husbands and future-ex-wives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It\'s kind of like Alice in Wonderland down the rabbit hole," one insider tells us.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This show is a re-run. It originally aired in&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/04/13/135354436/the-tuesday-podcast-a-former-crack-dealer-on-the-economics-of-drugs" target="_blank"&gt;April, 2011&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Lots of economists write about the economics of illegal drugs. Here\'s a&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=150070" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;from a Harvard guy. Here\'s&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/kevin.murphy/teaching/market%20for%20illegal%20goods-jpe.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;another&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;co-authored by a couple Chicago guys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;One thing missing from those papers: Actual drug dealers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;So for today\'s podcast, we run some economic theory by&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.freewayrick.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Freeway Rick Ross&amp;#160;&lt;/a&gt;(pictured), who was one of the biggest crack dealers in LA in the \'80s and \'90s. He went to prison in \'96, and was released on parole in \'09.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Economists say that people demand a "risk premium" to do illegal, risky work. But it didn\'t feel that way to Ross:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;When you come from where I was when I started selling drugs, you feel hopeless. You don\'t think you\'re going to live past 24 years old. Go to jail, come out with stripes. Really wasn\'t any risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Everything I had going on at the time, it was nothing. I was like a lump on a log. The risk most people would look at &amp;#8212; you could get killed, go to prison &amp;#8212; was Ok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;What\'s more, he really liked being a drug kingpin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;I loved it. ... I felt like I was powerful. ... It was every man\'s dream to be free. ... I\'d rather be doing that than anything else, almost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On the show today, the story of an innovation that changed the way the world works, and of the man who made this innovation possible. Luca Pacioli was a monk, a mathematician, a magician and possibly, the boyfriend of Leonardo da Vinci.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jane Gleeson-White, author of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Double-Entry-Merchants-Created-ebook/dp/B007Q6XKA8"&gt;Double Entry: How the Merchants of Venice Created Modern Finance&lt;/a&gt;, tells us the story of Pacioli and how his book on mathematics changed business across the planet.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Earlier this year, we created a presidential candidate. A fake candidate, sure. But a candidate with real ideas &amp;#8212; ideas embraced by economists across the political spectrum, and rejected by every politician who wants to get elected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Getting rid of the mortgage-interest tax deduction. Eliminating corporate taxes. Legalizing marijuana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On the show today, we bring in real political consultants to help us plan a campaign for our fake candidate. Our goal: Sell our candidate to America by making economics sexy.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Global trade wars. Small-time bike thieves. And what happens when the Fed talks big. On today\'s show, we bring you three short Planet Money stories.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 13px;"&gt;We play with a computer model of our broken economy and try to fix it. &amp;#160;It turns out not to be so easy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;A few months back, we set up a couple shell companies &amp;#8212; Unbeliezable, Inc., in Belize, and Delawho? in Delaware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we talk to some tax lawyers to try to figure out what we can do with our companies. We draft a resolution so we can go to Belize to meet the fake director and fake shareholder of our company. And we learn owning shell companies in tax havens is a lot more of a hassle than we thought.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Earlier this summer, we assembled five prominent economists from across the political spectrum and gave them a simple task: Identify major economic policies they could all stand behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;They agreed on a broad economic platform that would sink any political candidate that supported it. (Here\'s the&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/07/18/156928675/episode-387-the-no-brainer-economic-platform" target="_blank"&gt;show&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;we did on their platform; here\'s a&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/07/19/157047211/six-policies-economists-love-and-politicians-hate" target="_blank"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Today, we talk to those economists again. This time, we hear a bunch of the ideas some of them liked but others shot down &amp;#8212; including free heroin for addicts, a new tax on financial speculation, and $2 trillion in new, deficit spending on infrastructure projects.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;A cab ride through the streets of Manhattan. A cramped room in Brooklyn where a man makes beautiful suits by hand. A company in Germany that can\'t hire workers fast enough. A trip to the moon and back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we have four short Planet Money stories.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;A decade ago, the Barilla pasta factory in Foggia, Italy, had a big problem with people skipping work. The absentee rate was around 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;People called in sick all the time, typically on Mondays, or on days when there was a big soccer game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Foggia is in southern Italy. Barilla\'s big factory in northern Italy had a much lower absentee rate. This is not surprising; there\'s a huge economic gap between southern and northern Italy. It\'s like two different countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Barilla execs told Nicola Calandrea, the manager of the Foggia plant, that they would close the factory unless he brought the absenteeism rate down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Calandrea decided that to save the factory, he had to change the culture. On today\'s show, we visit the factory and hear how Calandrea made it work.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;On today\'s show, we hit the streets of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt; with economist &lt;a href="http://timharford.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Tim Harford&lt;/a&gt;. In his book, &lt;a href="http://timharford.com/books/adapt/" target="_blank"&gt;Adapt&lt;/a&gt;, Harford argues that success always starts with failure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Harford takes us on a failure tour of New York.&amp;#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Highlights include a Gutenberg Bible (turns out the Bible business wasn\'t so good to Gutenberg) and the Woolworth Building &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;(Woolworth\'s had some great innovations in its day, but eventually got beat by big-box stores).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Failure, Harford argues, is essential to economic growth. Old companies fail and are replaced by newer companies with fresh ideas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Perhaps inevitably, we wind up on Wall Street.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;"Of course we have this classic phrase now, \'too big to fail,\'" Harford says. "That really tells you what was wrong with Wall Street: We created institutions that couldn\'t fail safely."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Tony Mata is a meat inventor; his job is figuring out new things to do with meat. He thinks he recently discovered a new steak &amp;#8212; a novel way to cut up a chunk of beef that\'s currently not worth much. Mata is so excited about his discovery that he\'s trying to patent it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;This raises a basic question: Can you patent a steak?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we talk to Mata. We visit the workshop of Gene Gagliardi, the inventor of Steak-Umm and KFC\'s popcorn chicken. And we try to figure out what meat inventors tell us about patents and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we talk to Nicholas Wapshott, author of Keynes Hayek: The Clash That Defined Modern Economics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That clash is still clashing today. Paul Ryan has cited Hayek as an influence (though they disagree on some key points); President Obama has clearly been influenced by Keynes. And, really, there\'s no way to reconcile the ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This election is about two profound, competing theories that really can\'t exist in the same room at the same time," Wapshott says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s on.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;The city of Harrisburg, Pa owes over &lt;a href="http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2012/05/harrisburgs_eye-popping_debt_t.html" target="_blank"&gt;$1.5 billion&lt;/a&gt;. David Unkovic, the city\'s former receiver, &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/03/23/149058391/trying-to-save-a-broke-city" target="_blank"&gt;tried to save&lt;/a&gt; the broke city, but his plan just led to political trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, Unkovic left a scrawled, handwritten &lt;a href="http://media.pennlive.com/midstate_impact/other/unkovic-letter.PDF" target="_blank"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; on the steps of the courthouse. "I find myself in an untenable position in the political and ethical crosswinds," the letter said, "and am no longer in a position to effectuate a solution."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unkovic fled Harrisburg and stopped answering emails, phone calls, and questions from the press. Until recently. He\'s started to speak out about what drove Harrisburg into debt &amp;#8212; and what drove him out of town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the show today, Unkovic speaks. And eats a Philly pretzel.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Thomas Peterffy\'s life story includes a typing robot, a proto-iPad, and a vast fortune he amassed as one of the first guys to use computers in financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, Peterffy tells us his story &amp;#8212; and he explains why he\'s worried about the financial world he helped create.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;We learned of Peterffy\'s story from the forthcoming book&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Automate-This-Algorithms-Came-World/dp/1591844924" target="_blank"&gt;Automate This&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Maastricht is the home of the euro. It\'s the Dutch town where European leaders signed the treaty that created the single currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;It\'s also a place where it\'s legal for "coffeeshops" to sell marijuana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Tourists from around Europe used to come to Maastricht to get high. Recently, though, Maastricht\'s mayor soured on marijuana tourism, and the town banned the sale of the drug to foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show: Even in the home of the euro, the European Dream still isn\'t a reality.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;In spite of the drought, many U.S. farmers will do just fine this year. They are, after all, covered by crop insurance &amp;#8212; a program that costs U.S. taxpayers $7 billion a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we travel to Fairbury, Illinois. We meet three generations of farmers who tell us that, even without government-subsidized crop insurance, their farms would survive the drought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why does the government spend so much on crop insurance programs? We talk to an ag economist who has a surprising answer.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we visit an office building that straddles the border between Germany and the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On one side of the building, there\'s a German mailbox and a German policeman. On the other side, a Dutch mailbox and a Dutch policeman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;The building was supposed to make it easy to work in both countries. But it\'s also a reminder of how the European dream isn\'t yet a reality.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On Jan. 8, 1835, all the big political names in Washington gathered to celebrate what President Andrew Jackson had just accomplished. A senator rose to make the big announcement: "Gentlemen ... the national debt ... is PAID."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was the one time in U.S. history when the country was debt free. It lasted exactly one year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s Planet Money: The legend of the national debt. Where the debt came from, what happened the one time we paid it all off, and why Congress created the debt ceiling in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This episode originally aired on May 13, 2011.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;The monthly jobs numbers are important &amp;#8212; really important. They tell everyone from manufacturers to stock traders how the economy is doing. Billions of dollars ride on the jobs numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Get them early, and you\'d have everything you need to make a quick fortune. And once &amp;#8212; just once, as far as anyone knows &amp;#8212; someone did get them early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we talk to the guy who got the numbers before everyone else. And we learn the crazy lengths the government now goes to in order to keep those numbers secret until it\'s time to release them.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;There\'s a pill called Suboxone that treats addiction to heroin and pain pills like oxycontin. Doctors and addicts say it\'s amazing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;"It was the best thing that ever happened," one heroin addict told us. "I was like OH. MY. LORD. This is a miracle pill."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;The government spent tens of millions of dollars developing Suboxone. Doctors can prescribe it in their offices. But a lot of people who want it can\'t get it from a doctor, so they have to buy it on the street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Today on the show: Why people have to turn to drug dealers to get a pill that fights addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we dive deep into the world of offshore companies and bank accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We set up our own &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/news/graphics/2012/07/pm-offshore/offshoredocuments.pdf"&gt;company&lt;/a&gt; in an offshore tax haven, and we find out where the easiest place to register a business anonymously is.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;For today\'s show, we\'ve collected three Planet Money radio stories never before heard on the show. All of them deal with people who handle other people\'s money &amp;#8212; a politician\'s, a workforce\'s, and even a continent\'s:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/07/20/157119003/just-how-blind-are-blind-trusts-anyway" target="_blank"&gt;Just How Blind Are Blind Trusts, Anyway?&lt;/a&gt;: With questions swirling about Mitt Romney\'s investments, a look at how blind trusts really work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/07/13/156705409/the-european-central-banks-guide-to-influence" target="_blank"&gt;The European Central Bank\'s Guide To Influence&lt;/a&gt;: With much of the continent on shaky financial grounds, the ECB is all about influencing governments, not making friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/07/20/157060335/public-pensions-are-about-to-look-less-healthy" target="_blank"&gt;Public Pensions Are About To Look Less Healthy&lt;/a&gt;: Accounting rules are changing, and that could mean a nasty surprise for a lot of public employees. (And for more on just what\'s behind the change, see Monday\'s blog post,&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/07/23/156323322/why-public-pensions-are-about-to-look-less-healthy" target="_blank"&gt;Why Public Pensions Are About To Look Less Healthy&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Given a choice between $50 now and $100 in a month, many people would take the money now. But offered $50 in a year, or $100 in 13 months, they\'d wait the extra month to double their money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lesson: People have a "present bias," says &lt;a href="http://frankpartnoy.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Frank Partnoy&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of law and finance at the University of San Diego. "So people have more impatience in a one-month time period than they do in a one-year time period."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This turns out to have immense implications for public policy &amp;#8212; implications that add up to many trillions of dollars over time, and mean the difference between valuing the lives of future generations at a few pennies, or hundreds of billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider: If it would cost several trillion dollars to save Los Angeles from being &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2011/01/20/20greenwire-200-year-flood-in-calif-more-devastating-than-80143.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank"&gt;wiped off the map&lt;/a&gt; by massive floods that are likely to occur only once every few hundred years, is it worth it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer hinges on the discount rate &amp;#8212; the rate you use to size up future costs.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;There\'s a reason economists don\'t run for president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;We assembled five prominent economists from across the political spectrum. We gave them a simple task: Identify major economic policies they could all stand behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;They did. They gave us five tax proposals &amp;#8212; plus one change to the criminal code &amp;#8212; that every one of them could support wholeheartedly, from left to right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;And in the process, they gave us an economic platform that would surely sink any candidate that supported it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show: The Planet Money economic platform. Backed by the brightest minds in modern economics. Pure poison to any politician that embraces it.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Everybody likes free. But free can be dangerous, too. Today\'s show is sort of the flip side of free. It is what happens when you take something that was free &amp;#8212; and you give it a price, a decision many Internet companies face today. &lt;em&gt;That &lt;/em&gt;is a highly risky move, it turns out. And the damage can be enormous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, free of charge, Chana Joffe-Walt and Alex Blumberg tell the story of the Red Cross and free doughnuts &amp;#8212; that suddenly weren\'t free any more. It happened 70 years ago, and the Red Cross is still feeling the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;You\'ll hear the complaint every now and then, when the global economy comes up, that the United States is becoming like Greece, or Spain, or Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;But when&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/luigi.zingales/" target="_blank"&gt;Luigi Zingales&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;says it, he should know: He\'s a University of Chicago economist. He was born in Italy. He studies, among other things, what has set the American economy apart from places like Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;And he\'s worried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show: How the U.S. is taking a few early steps down the risky road toward Italy, and how it could change course.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;It\'s really, really hard to create the right kind of economic incentives &amp;#8212; even if you\'re a professional economist, and all you\'re trying to do is teach your kids to use the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s Planet Money, we talk to economist&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.joshuagans.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Joshua Gans&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;and his 11-year-old daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Gans, who wrote a book called&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262012782?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=coreecon-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0262012782" target="_blank"&gt;Parentonomics&lt;/a&gt;, tried to create a toilet-training economy for his young children. He rewarded them with candy for sitting on the toilet &amp;#8212; and the older ones got candy if they helped the younger ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;But, like tiny Wall-Street bankers, the kids figured out how to work the system for maximum advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;His daughter managed to go to the bathroom every 20 minutes, all day long. For a while, she got a treat every time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;She also wrung everything she could out of her brother:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;I realized that if I helped my brother go to the toilet, I would get rewarded, too. And I realized that the more that goes in, the more comes out. So I was just feeding my brother buckets and buckets of water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also on the podcast&lt;/strong&gt;: We discuss the&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/07/06/156196624/how-unemployment-has-dragged-on-in-three-charts" target="_blank"&gt;jobs numbers&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;that the government reported today. And we talked about this&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NaGuPdnffEI/T_bclZslf8I/AAAAAAAAODQ/P4I-fuSaOuY/s1600/EmployRecJune2012.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;graph&lt;/a&gt;, the most vivid illustration you\'ll see of how slow this recovery is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Part of today\'s show is a rerun. It first ran in&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2010/08/20/129328075/the-tuesday-podcast-allowance-economics" target="_blank"&gt;August, 2010&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;There\'s a certain amount of trust underpinning the financial markets. But recent news out of the United Kingdom has shaken the world\'s faith in a key element of the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;That element is the number banks use to determine how much to charge their customers &amp;#8212; think of it as the measuring stick that determines nearly every other other interest rate around: mortgages, credit cards, corporate loans, complex derivatives transactions. It\'s called&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.bbalibor.com/" target="_blank"&gt;LIBOR&lt;/a&gt;, or the London Interbank Offered Rate, and it pretty much underpins everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;For years, the British Bankers\' Association has calculated the rate by asking big banks what they are paying to borrow from other banks. The answers were largely taken on faith. Now it turns out that at least one big bank &amp;#8212; Barclays &amp;#8212; was skewing the numbers, during the financial crisis and before. Emails cited in a&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.cftc.gov/ucm/groups/public/@lrenforcementactions/documents/legalpleading/enfbarclaysorder062712.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;regulatory complaint&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;against the bank show the casual way the efforts were discussed. Other banks are under investigation as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;The result: Criminal and parliamentary inquiries on two continents, lawsuits, and a lot of mistrust and uncertainty about interest rates across the financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we look at how Barclays bankers sought to manipulate Libor, and why the repercussions will be felt throughout the global financial system for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;The Supreme Court\'s decision to uphold the health-care law will change peoples\' lives. On today\'s show, we talk to a few of those people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;When the ruling came down, we were visiting people who work at a health insurance agency in Connecticut. The Court\'s ruling means the company needs to find a new line of business or close down altogether. (Here\'s&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/06/29/155936131/after-years-of-uncertainty-a-health-care-business-gets-an-answer"&gt;more on our visit&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Also, we hear how people\'s lives changed when they lost health insurance &amp;#8212; and when they got it.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Public companies helped build America. They gave millions of people the opportunity to buy a stake in the national economy. And, of course, they made some people very rich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, though, going public doesn\'t hold the same allure it once did for many entrepreneurs. "In Silicon Valley, there is a general attitude that the cool kids sell their companies rather than going public," Spencer Rascoff told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rascoff is the CEO of Zillow &amp;#8212; which did go public. On today\'s show, Rascoff makes the case for going public. And we hear from another CEO who is blowing off the bankers pushing him toward an IPO.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;A few years ago, Jestina Clayton started a hair braiding business in her home in Centerville, Utah. The business let her stay home with her kids, and in good months, she made enough to pay for groceries. She even put an ad on a local website. Then one day she got an email from a stranger who had seen the ad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;"It is illegal in the state of Utah to do any form of extensions without a valid cosmetology license," the e-mail read. "Please delete your ad, or you will be reported."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;To get a license, Jestina would have to spend more than a year in cosmetology school. Tuition would cost $16,000 dollars or more.&amp;#160;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On today\'s show: Why it\'s illegal to braid hair without a license in Utah. And why that rule &amp;#8212; and hundreds of others like it in states all around the country &amp;#8212; are a disaster for the U.S. economy.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Say you\'ve messed up so badly that the only people who will offer you help want your pain and suffering in exchange. They want, to use a fashionable term, austerity. Do you have to accept it? What if that turns out that the pain and suffering is a 20-year detour detour into economic collapse?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we hear from a Greek economist about the options open to the country. And we talk to a Greek couple that\'s getting married tomorrow. They\'re not sure how they\'re going to pay for the wedding.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;For decades there was this debate about Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one side were people making what seems like the straightforward argument: People who get Medicaid fare better than people who don\'t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other side were those making the contrarian argument. They argued that there is already a safety net for the poor and the uninsured, and that Medicaid\'s reimbursement rates are so low that most doctors don\'t see Medicaid patients anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debate was perennial and unresolvable. You couldn\'t simply compare people with Medicaid to those without, because the two groups had different characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To truly answer the question, you would need to take a big group of people, and randomly divide them into two groups. One group would get Medicaid, and the other wouldn\'t. But doing that would be unethical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, a few years back, Oregon announced that it had 10,000 new slots in its Medicaid program. Far more than 10,000 people wanted to enroll. So the state held a lottery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state of Oregon didn\'t mean to be creating the perfect experiment to test whether Medicaid actually helps people. But that\'s what it was doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/faculty/katherine-baicker/" target="_blank"&gt;Katherine Baicker&lt;/a&gt;, a health economist at Harvard, followed people who entered the Oregon Medicaid lottery &amp;#8212; and she compared the outcomes between those who were given Medicaid, and those who were denied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we talk to her about what she learned &amp;#8212; and we hear ger findings mean for the debate over health care in America.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we take you backstage in Spain\'s banking mess, the latest front in the never ending financial crisis that is Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;It\'s the story of how a group of people tried to fix a problem, but wound up creating a banking monster.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Lincolns used to be the coolest cars in the world. They used to be driven by kings, moguls and celebrities. Today, Lincolns are driven by the old, the out-of-touch, and the guys hustling you at the airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;On today\'s show: How Lincoln is trying to regain its former glory &amp;#8212; and how the story of Lincoln may be the story of the U.S. auto industry, for better or for worse.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Once a bank run starts, it takes on a logic of its own. Even a solid, solvent bank can\'t hold up for long if people start to panic. This is a problem for Europe right now, as depositors continue to pull money out of banks in Spain and Greece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we talk to Douglas Diamond, an economist who is one of the go-to guys on bank runs, and we hear from Greek bank teller who is handing out euros to panicked depositors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We walk through the three things you can do to stop a bank run &amp;#8212; and figure out what options are left for Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BONUS:&lt;/strong&gt; Check out our special &lt;a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/zchace/playlist/4abo7GJeZDZztU7rDYcqsT"&gt;bank run playlist&lt;/a&gt; assembled by Zoe Chace.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;As the world considers the possible death of the euro, it\'s worth considering a famous historical example. Ok, it\'s not that famous. But it\'s still worth looking at: The break-up of the Austro-Hungarian currency union in 1918.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;Just as the countries of Europe today share the euro, the Austrian empire and the Kingdom of Hungary had created a shared currency: the Austro-Hungarian crown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;After World War I, the region broke up. All of a sudden there were lots of countries wanting to switch to their own currencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;At the beginning, they used a simple system: Countries simply stamped existing Austro-Hungarian currency with particular markings to turn it into new, domestic currency. Some countries used ornate samps; Romania\'s stamp was just a cross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;This quickly led to chaos. Everyone wanted to get their money stamped in the country they thought would have the strongest currency. Countries sealed their borders, but it was no use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;"You had boxcar loads of currency" moving across borders, says Michael Spencer, an economist who has written about this period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;It turns out, killing a currency is hard to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*&amp;#160;Note: Today\'s podcast is a rerun. It first ran in&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/11/08/142147427/the-tuesday-podcast-kill-the-euro-win-400-000" target="_blank"&gt;November, 2011&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;States across the country have promised their employees sweet retirement benefits, but haven\'t set aside enough money to pay for those benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we hear from Illinois, which owes its state pension funds $83 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we hear from the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. territory halfway around the world. The territory may point to the future for many U.S. states: It just became the first American public pension fund to file for bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;The uprisings in Syria, Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen all started last spring. They\'ve all resulted in regime change &amp;#8212; except for the uprising in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is Syria locked in a brutal and seemingly endless conflict? The answer has to do with history, politics, and a growing class of entrepreneurs who are struggling to pick a side. Their decision could turn the tide of the conflict. It could also cost them their lives.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we follow a couple guys who run a pizza shop in New Orleans as they buy their first Facebook ad. We visit a business in New Jersey that sells Facebook "likes" in bulk. And we check in with a business school professor who explains what Facebook would have to do to live up to its valuation &amp;#8212; which, even after its post-IPO fall, is still roughly $90 billion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;Ashley Dias is 26 years old. She has cystic fibrosis. About six weeks ago, her lungs gave out. She was rushed to the Cleveland Clinic and told she\'d need a lung transplant to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;Lungs are a scarce resource. But unlike many scarce resources, lungs aren\'t for sale. So doctors have had to develop a system to allocate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;Ashley\'s life depends on that system.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Every single dollar bill in the world &amp;#8212; every $20, every $100, everything &amp;#8212; is printed on paper made at one small mill in Massachusetts. That\'s been the case for 130 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we visit the mill. We hear the story of the guy who jumped out a hotel window to win the government contract to print all that paper. And we ask: Will anybody be using paper money in 50 years?&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we visit beautiful Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;Price of one year at Lafayette: $55,688. Up 63 percent from the price a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;At least, that\'s the sticker price &amp;#8212; the price you get if you add up tuition, room and board, and all the fees listed on the school\'s website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;But there\'s a huge gap between the sticker price and what the average student actually pays after figuring in grants and scholarships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;That\'s true at private colleges around the country. Nationwide, the average sticker price is more than twice as high as the price students actually pay, and the gap is getting wider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;It turns out, it makes economic sense to have a high sticker price and offer lots of discounts. On the show today, we explain why.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;We\'re in a gym full of high school students. The gym is at the headquarters of the New York Federal Reserve, just a few blocks from Wall Street. The students are here for the High School Fed Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;If you\'re a high school student and you dream of holding the U.S. economy in the palm of your hand &amp;#8212; if you want the power to control interest rates and to print money out of thin air &amp;#8212; the Fed Challenge is for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we sit in on the finals &amp;#8212; and hear from a bunch of teenagers about what Fed policy means for them.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;Ian Bremmer calls his big idea "G-Zero." Here\'s how he described it in an&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/67339/ian-bremmer-and-nouriel-roubini/a-g-zero-world" target="_blank"&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;last year:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;We are now living in a G-Zero world, one in which no single country or bloc of countries has the political and economic leverage &amp;#8212; or the will &amp;#8212; to drive a truly international agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we take a world tour with Bremmer to find out who thrives and who struggles in a G-Zero world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;Bremmer is the president of&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://eurasiagroup.net/about-eurasia-group/who-is/ian-bremmer" target="_blank"&gt;Eurasia Group&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;and author of a new book called&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ianbremmer.com/book/every-nation-itself-winners-and-losers-g-zero-world" target="_blank"&gt;Every Nation for Itself: Winners and Losers in a G-Zero World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. For more, listen to our&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/01/28/132742511/the-friday-podcast-g-zero" target="_blank"&gt;G-Zero podcast&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;from last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we bring you three Planet Money radio stories:&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Pay Your Taxes: A Cautionary Tale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When IRS agents raided the house of rapper Young Buck, they seized all his things: his white leather dining chairs, his watches, his craps table, his tattoo kit. Even his refrigerator. The Nashville artist, who was once part of 50 Cent\'s &lt;a href="http://www.g-unitsoldier.com/"&gt;G-Unit&lt;/a&gt;, owed hundreds of thousands of dollars in back taxes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. On The Million-Dollar Trail Of A Mystery SuperPAC Donor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The superPACs raising money to support presidential candidates have few restrictions. They can accept checks for any amount. One rule they do have: They must reveal who donated money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. We Stand At The Doorstep Of A Foreclosed House. Then We Go In.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Florida, the foreclosure process takes 861 days, on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means houses often sit in limbo for more than two years after the owner stops paying the mortgage. Maybe the homeowner is still living in the house. Maybe he\'s renting it out. Maybe squatters are living there, or maybe it\'s empty and falling down.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;In New York City, roughly 3,000 food trucks compete for the business of hungry office workers. Being in the right spot means the difference between fortune and ruin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many rules to finding that perfect parking space. Here are six of them:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show Robert Smith rides along in the Rickshaw Dumpling truck, driving from deep within Brooklyn to the heart of Manhattan in search of hungry customers.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;Like most central bank chiefs, Ben Bernanke tends toward understatement. But when he testified before Congress earlier this year, Bernanke went big.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;"On January 1, 2013," he said, "there\'s going to be a massive fiscal cliff of large spending cuts and tax increases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;One of the biggest parts of the fiscal cliff is the expiration of the tax cuts passed by President Bush and extended by President Obama. If Congress doesn\'t act before the end of the year, taxes will go up for most Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;Simon Johnson, our guest on today\'s show, thinks that would be a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;"Our critics say we are proposing a large, middle-class tax increase," Johnson says. "To which the answer is, yes. We are."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;He argues that a tax hike is necessary to pay for Social Security and Medicare, programs which are projected to become significantly more expensive in the coming decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;Johnson teaches economics at MIT and co-wrote the new book&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://whitehouseburning.com/" target="_blank"&gt;White House Burning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;Legislation in Congress would get rid of dollar bills and replace them with coins. Proponents say coins are easier to use and save the country money in the long run. The bill people say none of this is true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;Should we kill the dollar bill?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;On today\'s show we go deep into the nature of money itself, and we find a clear answer to this question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;We haul in a giant box of coins, talk to the guy who actually makes dollar bills, and watch a Senator try to use a vending machine.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Traditionally, when we think about bad behavior, we think about character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But psychologists who study bad behavior &amp;#8212; who study, say, fraud in the business world &amp;#8212; have found that that character doesn\'t explain everything. They\'ve found that a lot of unethical behavior can be explained by cognitive errors &amp;#8212; errors that affect almost everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we talk to a man who started out as an upstanding businessman, and went on to commit bank fraud involving millions of dollars. It drove several companies out of business and resulted in the loss of around a hundred jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We try to figure out why he did it, and what it means for the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Iceland has about as many people as Staten Island. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;It also has its own currency, the krona. This raises a question: Does it make sense to have a currency that\'s only used by 300,000 people?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;After the country\'s economy blew up in the financial crisis, the government put the krona on lock down. Now, they\'re trying to decide whether to stay with the krona, or abandon it, and use someone else\'s currency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Today\'s show features special guest host Baldur Hedinsson, a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;#160;former Planet Money intern who recently moved back to Iceland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;#160;We also hear from his sister, who is working in a town where people walk around with rifles to ward off polar bears. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;And we talk to Robert Mundell, who &lt;a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1999/press.html" target="_blank"&gt;won a Nobel&lt;/a&gt; for working on questions like the one Iceland&amp;#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;is facing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;How do you make money manufacturing a dry, bland cracker that a tiny percentage of the population eats just one week a year?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;On today\'s show, we go inside the matzo business.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;A rabbi at a matzo factory&amp;#160; explains why matzo is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em style="font-size: small;"&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt; to be hard to make. A Manischewitz exec tells us why all the rules for making kosher matzo are a boon to the company. And, perhaps inevitably, we explain what all this has to do with the 21st century economy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we eat artisanal beef jerky, sort through the wreckage of the financial crisis, watch Nancy Pelosi raise money, and meet high priced nannies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;It\'s is a collection of our recent radio stories. Here\'s more:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/02/24/147291416/a-revival-in-american-manufacturing-led-by-brooklyn-foodies"&gt;A Revival In American Manufacturing, Led By Brooklyn Foodies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/04/03/149937079/wisc-school-districts-saved-after-bad-investment" target="_blank"&gt;Wisconsin School Districts Saved After Bad Investment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/03/30/149698946/on-tour-with-nancy-pelosi-fundraising-rock-star"&gt;On Tour With Nancy Pelosi, Fundraising Rock Star&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/03/29/149525587/the-200-000-a-year-nanny"&gt;The $200,000-A-Year Nanny&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;David Unkovic is a thoughtful, mild-mannered guy who was appointed to save Harrisburg, Pa. The city had gone broke, and it was Unkovic\'s job to figure out how to fix things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;We visited Harrisburg a few weeks back. We talked to Unkovic. We talked to some of the people in Harrisburg who were suing him. And we visited the incinerator, a boondoggle that drove the city to bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;Then, last week, Unkovic quit. "I find myself in an untenable position in the political and ethical crosswinds," his&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://media.pennlive.com/midstate_impact/other/unkovic-letter.PDF" target="_blank"&gt;handwritten resignation letter&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;says. "I wish the citizens of Harrisburg well in their ongoing quest for fiscal stability and good government, both of which they truly deserve."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;Since resigning, Unkovic has gone missing. And he hasn\'t returned our calls or emails.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;If you serve in Congress, you have two jobs: Making laws, and raising money to run for re-election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out, that second job &amp;#8212; raising money to run for re-election &amp;#8212; is a lot easier if you serve on certain Congressional committees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we reveal which committees are a fundraising goldmine. And which committees actually make it harder for Congressmen to raise money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The show is a preview of our hour long special this weekend on This American Life &amp;#8212; &lt;a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/461/take-the-money-and-run-for-office" target="_blank"&gt;Take The Money And Run For Office&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt; On today\'s show, we hear the story of a 16th century German weavers\' guild. They were savvy political operators, who knew how to push their competitors out of the market. They set up a system of fines, wage ceilings, and public rebukes that would be the envy of a modern cartel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt; It\'s a tale of economic monopoly and discrimination. Of inequality and conflict. And it\'s a story of how businesses can stifle innovation even today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt; Our guest is Sheilagh Ogilvie, an economic historian at Cambridge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;The U.S. has a really conflicted history with the income tax. For most of American history, there was no income tax at all. At one point it was ruled unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, income tax is the federal government\'s main source of revenue. That raises a question: How did something that was once so strange to us become so central?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer includes a few wars, a Supreme Court justice on his deathbed, and Donald Duck.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;Willow Tufano is a 14-year-old girl who recently bought a house in Florida for $12,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;Willow and her mom split the cost of the house, which they\'re now renting out. Willow saved up money by selling stuff from foreclosed homes on Craigslist; she plans to buy out her mom\'s share in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;We did a&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/03/09/148218539/this-14-year-old-girl-just-bought-a-house-in-florida" _mce_href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/03/09/148218539/this-14-year-old-girl-just-bought-a-house-in-florida" target="_blank"&gt;radio story&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;about Willow earlier this month. The story took off.

And we hear more from the neighborhood where Willow lives. It\'s a place where people who bought at the top of the bubble &amp;#8212; including Willow\'s family &amp;#8212; live next to people who bought identical homes at a fraction of the price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;And we discuss whether a 14-year-old girl buying a house is a sign that that housing market has finally bottomed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we talk with a former manager at&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2009/01/dont_believe_what_we_say.html" _mce_href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2009/01/dont_believe_what_we_say.html" target="_blank"&gt;Countrywide Financial&lt;/a&gt;. Cynder Niemela describes what life was like inside the giant mortgage lender back in 2006. It\'s not pretty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.iwatchnews.org/authors/michael-hudson" _mce_href="http://www.iwatchnews.org/authors/michael-hudson" target="_blank"&gt;Mike Hudson&lt;/a&gt;, an investigative reporter with the Center For Public Integrity, is our special guest host for the show. He picked through the wreckage of the housing crisis and talked to dozens of people at big mortgage companies to find out what the mortgage industry was like back then.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;Today\'s show, in three bullet points:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;How the European Central Bank finally used its super power.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;What that has to do with a guy who owns a bar on the coast of Spain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;And why this may not be the end of Europe\'s debt saga.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;On today\'s show, we visit Fulper Farms, a family-run dairy in New Jersey. It\'s a bucolic setting &amp;#8212; white farmhouse, rolling hills, etc. But behind that peaceful image lies all the roiling tension, rising inequality and economic volatility of the 21st-century economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;We meet Claudia, the prized, high-tech cow. We meet Claudia\'s less-accomplished neighbor, Cow #6. And we learn why even a barn full of Claudias wouldn\'t be enough to keep a family-run dairy afloat.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches that each Mormon in good standing should tithe 10 percent of his or her income.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;"That\'s written in stone, and preached from the pulpit," says Gordon Dahl, an economist at the University of California, San Diego, who is Mormon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;But while the church is very precise about that figure &amp;#8212; 10 percent of income &amp;#8212; it does not tell its members what income means.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;"Which is really interesting to us economists, because we want to know how people define income," says Dahl.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;As anyone who has ever done their taxes knows, figuring out what counts as income is harder than it sounds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;On the show today, we look into how Mormons figure out how much to tithe, and what that tells us about how people think about income and taxes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;Today on the show, we visit a giant pool of money &amp;#8212; worth trillions of U.S. dollars! &amp;#8212; at the&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.pbc.gov.cn/publish/english/963/index.html" _mce_href="http://www.pbc.gov.cn/publish/english/963/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;People\'s Bank of China&lt;/a&gt;, the country\'s central bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;To understand how the money got there, we talk to Jacky Jiang and Rosalia Yang, a pair of very friendly exporters who show us around a factory where they make fake-wood flooring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;They tell us about the changes China is going through, and explain why that pool of money might soon start flowing back to the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Today, in the second of our two-part series on private equity, we take another look at Bain Capital &amp;#8212; the firm co-founded by Mitt Romney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last Tuesday, in the &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/02/23/147289259/how-mitt-romneys-firm-transformed-a-struggling-company-in-5-steps" target="_blank"&gt;first part&lt;/a&gt; of the series, we looked at a deal Bain did during Romney\'s tenure that went bad. Today, we tell the story of a deal that turned out better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we dig into the arguments about private equity\'s broad role in the economy.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;"History is a battle between creditors and debtors," Philip Coggan says on today\'s show. "Every so often these two clash, there is a crisis and the whole system is remade."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coggan, who writes the &lt;a href="http://www.economist.com/search/apachesolr_search/buttonwood?filters=type%3Aarticle" target="_blank"&gt;Buttonwood&lt;/a&gt; column for the Economist, is author of the book &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/books/titles/146489652/paper-promises-debt-money-and-the-new-world-order" target="_blank"&gt;Paper Promises: Debt, Money, and the New World Order&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We had a crisis in the 1930s, in the 1970s and we\'ve got another one now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We\'re not even close to resolving the latest crisis, according to Coggan. The debate over debt is "what politics and economics are going to be about for the next 10 years," he says.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Are private-equity firms job-destroying monsters? Or are they knights in shining armor, riding in to fix troubled companies and make the economy work better?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you have a presidential candidate who used to run a private-equity firm, the arguments tend to shed more heat than light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we decided to look at what private equity firms actually do &amp;#8212; by telling the stories of two companies purchased by Bain Capital, the private equity firm co-founded by Mitt Romney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we look at a deal gone bad. On a future podcast, we\'ll look at another deal that turned out differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romney\'s campaign wouldn\'t comment on tape for the podcast, but they did send us this statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mitt Romney spent 25 years as a businessman and entrepreneur. ... At Bain Capital, he helped launch and guide a private equity and financial services firm. Bain Capital invested in many businesses; while not every business was successful, the firm had an excellent overall track record and created jobs with well-known companies like Staples, Dominos, and Sports Authority."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;When you walk around a big city in China, it feels like an entrepreneurial free-for-all &amp;#8212; guys selling stuff on street corners, lots of little shops, everybody hustling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;But when you pull back the curtain on the country\'s economy, you find the government everywhere. The government owns, among other things, the country\'s biggest cell phone carrier, the three biggest airlines and the four biggest banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;Those state-owned banks in particular play a central role in the country\'s economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;Chinese people have one of the highest savings rates in the world, and they don\'t have many options for investing the money they save. So they put lots of their money in ordinary savings accounts at those state-owned banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;The banks, in turn, lend a lot of that money out to other government-owned companies, typically at very low interest rates. Those companies go out and build lots of new stuff. All that building contributes a huge chunk of China\'s growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;But the building can\'t go on forever. In fact, China may already have built too much stuff with borrowed money.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;What should the government pay for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;On today\'s Planet Money, we pose that question to Charlie Wheelan, author of the book&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Naked-Economics-Undressing-Dismal-Science/dp/0393324869" _mce_href="http://www.amazon.com/Naked-Economics-Undressing-Dismal-Science/dp/0393324869" target="_blank"&gt;Naked Economics&lt;/a&gt;, and one-time Congressional candidate. (He lost).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;He gives us the econ 101 answer: The government should definitely pay for something if it\'s a public good, which Charlie defines as "something that we all need that will make our lives better, but the market will not and cannot provide."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;The textbook example is a lighthouse.&amp;#160;Other examples of public goods include national defense and autopsies. Everyone benefits from the medical knowledge autopsies provide, but it\'s not really in any individual\'s interest to pay for an autopsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;Somehow, this fact leads us to call 1-800-AUTOPSY.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Today\'s podcast originally aired in 2010.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show: Four genius ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These ideas, as it happens, have all appeared in Planet Money radio stories. But they\'ve never been on the podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Man. A Van. A Surprising Business Plan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rethinking The Oreo For Chinese Consumers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What Do The Dow\'s Daily Swings Mean? Not Much.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How A Computer Scientist Tried To Save Greece&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Can we have a banking system that provides good services to people at reasonable rates? A banking system that doesn\'t bring down the global economy every few decades?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anat Admati thinks we can. She\'s a finance professor at Stanford, but she never paid much attention to banks until the financial crisis. (This is not unusual in the superspecialized world of academia.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the crisis hit, Admati started reading up on banks. And, in a basic banking textbook, she came upon a single line that changed her career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I sat in my office and I thought, \'Something is really wrong in banking.\' "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, Admati tells us what she thinks is wrong in banking &amp;#8212; and how she thinks we can fix it.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;div style="background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; margin: 8px;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what it\'s like to host the Super Bowl: For one weekend, your city is the focus of the sporting universe. Fans flock in droves. They eat at your restaurants and sleep in your hotels. They buy the "I &amp;#9829; your city]" t-shirts.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NFL estimates that hosting the country\'s premier sporting event will give the local economy a $300-400 million jolt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economist Victor Matheson doesn\'t buy it..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In today\'s podcast, Matheson, a professor at the College of Holy Cross, presents the case against hosting the Super Bowl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we hear how a hobby turns into a lucrative one-man business &amp;#8212; and how Apple\'s &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/from-the-app-store/" _mce_href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/from-the-app-store/" target="_blank"&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt; is transforming the Internet economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gist is super simple. In fact, it\'s something that\'s been going on in the physical world for thousands of years: Giving people a convenient way to buy cheap products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our guest on the show is &lt;a href="http://www.marco.org/about" _mce_href="http://www.marco.org/about" target="_blank"&gt;Marco Arment&lt;/a&gt;, one of the founders of the blogging platform &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDEQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tumblr.com%2F&amp;ei=ZGYoT_20Narr0gHi3OjMAg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFh97DEcbVqUP_rsHakdhXGRoJ5Vw" _mce_href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDEQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tumblr.com%2F&amp;ei=ZGYoT_20Narr0gHi3OjMAg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFh97DEcbVqUP_rsHakdhXGRoJ5Vw" target="_blank"&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;. A few years back, Marco launched a little side project called &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDUQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.instapaper.com%2F&amp;ei=wmYoT-mUBem60AGNwMHSAg&amp;usg=AFQjCNGrTVltggybGL3zjkj5qejUJPd9sw" _mce_href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDUQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.instapaper.com%2F&amp;ei=wmYoT-mUBem60AGNwMHSAg&amp;usg=AFQjCNGrTVltggybGL3zjkj5qejUJPd9sw" target="_blank"&gt;Instapaper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On the podcast today, we get a glimpse from inside the room where money changes hands. Jimmy Williams used to lobby for the powerful National Association of Realtors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams tells us about some of the ridiculous issues he\'s lobbied for, the steady flow of money that congresspeople need, and how he wants to take down the crazy campaign finance system.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;It\'s the 11th hour for Europe\'s debt crisis. Again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greece still can\'t pay back all the money it owes. So it\'s trying to cut a deal with its creditors. (Again.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We\'ve been wondering for years: Who are the people who loaned money to Greece? Are they suckers? Brilliant investors?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s podcast we find someone who loaned Greece money: Hans Humes. He runs a hedge fund called Greylock Capital Management. Turns out, his office is just a few blocks away from ours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humes is one of the guys trying to hammer out a deal with Greece. He explains just how complicated the negotiations are &amp;#8212; and how, even among people who loaned Greece money, there are huge divisions.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Katy Perry killed it on the pop charts last year. She went No.1 five times. She was the most played artist on the radio. But the record industry is so weird, it\'s hard to know whether this kind of success translates into huge amounts of money for her label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much did the label spend on Katy Perry? And how much did they make?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we try to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;It seems like there\'s always some country or another that the United States is imposing sanctions on. The reasons change, but the idea is always the same: economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month, it\'s Iran. In response to Iran\'s alleged pursuit of nuclear weapons, President Obama signed a law that punishes banks for doing business with Iran\'s central bank. This makes it difficult, in theory, for Iran to sell its oil around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see why sanctions are so appealing for the U.S. government: Rather than go to war to stop Iran\'s nuclear program &amp;#8212; to risk American lives &amp;#8212; the U.S. can block money from going in and out of the country. That makes life miserable for the Iranians and, in theory, persuades them to give up their nuclear ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But do sanctions work? Have sanctions ever really worked? Today, we talk to Gary Hufbauer, author of the book Economic Sanctions Reconsidered. And we hear a first-hand account of what life in Iraq was like under the sanctions of the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;In 1978, a group of farmers in a Chinese village called Xiaogang wrote a secret contract and hid it in the roof of a mud hut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were afraid the document might get them executed. Instead, it wound up completely transforming the Chinese economy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On today\'s show, we travel to Xiaogang, and hear the farmers\' story.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;American manufacturing is dead, right? Not exactly. The dollar value of what we make here keeps going up and up. But the success of American manufacturers has come at a cost. The number of manufacturing jobs in this country has collapsed as factories replace workers with machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today on the podcast, we\'re going to take a trip to Greenville, South Carolina, where factories filled with bright shiny machines sit just across the train tracks from shuttered old mills. It\'s the perfect place to answer the question &amp;#8212; what is the state of the low skilled American worker?&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;You rarely see lard on menus. There aren\'t shelves and shelves of it in every supermarket. In this country, we\'ve sort of lost touch with the once beloved pig fat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On today\'s podcast, we ask &amp;#8212; who killed lard? Was it Upton Sinclair? His novel, &lt;em&gt;The Jungle&lt;/em&gt;, contained a memorable passage about the men who cook the lard and perhaps fell into the vats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or should we blame William Procter and James Gamble? It was their company which created a new alternative to lard &amp;#8212; the "pure and wholesome" Crisco.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span face="Times New Roman" size="3" style="font-family: \'Times New Roman\'; font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Sometimes it feels like all we talk about at Planet Money is how the economy is going down the tubes. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span face="Times New Roman" size="3" style="font-family: \'Times New Roman\'; font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Not today. &amp;#160;We visit a few people who have been doing well this year. There\'s a guy who buys and stores gold for investors, companies that sell off inventories when stores go bankrupt, and a guy in the coconut water business. &amp;#160;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s podcast, we take a page from radio newscaster &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=101315590"&gt;Paul Harvey&lt;/a&gt; and tell you "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YSkEfwFQ2U"&gt;the rest of the story&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="postcontent"&gt;&lt;div class="story"&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storylocation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We look back at the podcasts we\'ve done in 2011 and tell you what we got right, what we got wrong and how everything turned out in Wisconsin and Iceland. Plus, we try to to figure out why that Rihanna song that cost so much money, bombed on the radio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Giving and receiving gifts can be a joyful thing &amp;#8212; unless you\'re an economist. All those books that will never be read and ties that will never be worn are &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2009/11/podcast_happy_efficent_holiday.html" target="_blank"&gt;hugely inefficient&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate a possible solution, we went to a seventh-grade classroom at a public school in Brooklyn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The students were already familiar with the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is kind of silly, but I got a Power Ranger," Tadre Jones said. "I was grateful, but I didn\'t really like it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we had no trouble conscripting 10 kids to participate in an economic experiment that aimed to improve the efficiency of gift giving.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;Jack Abramoff, the former lobbyist, is out of prison and available for interviews. On today\'s show we talk to him &amp;#8212; not about his crimes, but about the legal kind of lobbying that goes on every day. And we find out, how much do companies benefit from the business of lobbying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;If you\'re looking for the beginning &amp;#8212; and, possibly, the end &amp;#8212; of the European financial crisis, you can find it in a single building: The Greek statistics office, at 46 Peireos Street in Athens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We visited recently and found what may be the world\'s most high-stakes game of office politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one side: The technocrats, led by Andreas Georgiou, who was appointed last year to run the office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other : The old guard, including Konstantinos Skordas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Georgiou\'s technocratic ways &amp;#8212; like reporting Greek deficit figures directly to European authorities &amp;#8212; have landed him in hot water with the old guard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His email was hacked, he says. His workers went out on strike. And now he faces a criminal investigation that could lead to life in prison.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year we reported on the pileup of more than a billion unwanted $1 coins in government vaults. It was the result of a law passed a few years back that ordered the mint to create coins honoring each U.S. president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the White House said it will end the program. A small number of dollar coins will continue to be minted for collectors, but the coins will no longer be put into circulation. The shift will save an estimated $50 million a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s podcast, we visit a vault full of unwanted dollar coins and talk to the lawmakers who created the program.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Last week, American Airlines became a member of a club it hoped never to be a part of &amp;#8212; major airlines that have declared bankruptcy. Before American came Pan Am, Delta, United, Northwest, US Airways, and Continental.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, fuel costs are high and planes are expensive &amp;#8212; but why is it that the industry continues to lose money year after year? By economist Severin Borenstein\'s count, domestic airlines have lost $60 billion dollars in the last three decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even airline executives don\'t deny it. Bob Crandall, the former CEO of American, famous for calling it a "nasty, rotten business," says he used to tell his employees not to buy the company\'s stock. Why? "Because airlines don\'t make money," says Crandall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the show today, Crandall tells us why running an airline is so darn hard, and Severin Borenstein explains why all these bankruptcies are actually good news for us passengers.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;European governments have turned their eyes skyward looking for a hero to save them from financial collapse. But the signal they\'ve sent into the skies over Europe is not the usual one in the shape of a bat, it\'s the initials E-C-B, the European Central Bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On today\'s podcast, we\'ll tell you about the ECB\'s super powers and explain why they are so reluctant to use them.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we go shopping. We\'re bringing you stories about how we spend our money and what these purchases teach us about economics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why Amazon Loses Money On Every Kindle Fire: The Kindle Fire is a book store, a movie theater and a record shop. And Amazon\'s the one selling the books, movies and music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why A New York Cheese Buyer Hangs On The Euro\'s Fate: Most of the cheese at Murray\'s Cheese Shop comes from Europe. And the cheese buyer\'s bonus hinges on the future of the euro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Income Gap, Explained With Candy Corn: The numbers detailing the income gap between rich and poor can be difficult to grasp so we use candy to help explain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, a story about the kinds of things governments pay for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Governments Pay People To Have Babies It\'s a strategy some countries have adopted to boost falling fertility rates. Here\'s why it often fails.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Last month here in New York City, two taxi medallions, the metal plates that make it legal to dive a cab in the city, sold for $1 million each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s podcast, we try to answer the question &amp;#8212; why? What makes these little pieces of metal worth so much?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get the answer, we go back to the 1930\'s with Graham Hodges, professor of history at Colgate University. Hodges says it all has to do with a famous and violent strike where cabs were set on fire in Times Square.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, we check in with Canadian economist and Bloomberg reporter Ilan Kolet to see how a taxi medallion stacks up against some of today\'s most popular investments. (Spoiler Alert: The taxi medallion beats out gold, by a lot.)&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;For today\'s show, we\'ve collected four Planet Money radio stories that never made it to the podcast. Think of it as an early Thanksgiving buffet:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What A Coin Toss Has To Do With The Housing Market \xe2\x80\x94 A simple experiment helps explain why there\'s still a glut of houses for sale, five years after the housing bubble popped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why Are Wedding Dresses So Expensive? \xe2\x80\x94 A better question, according to one economist: Why are brides willing to pay so much?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Requiem For Pork Bellies \xe2\x80\x94 The life and death of pork-belly futures, explained by a trader in Chicago\'s meat pit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spaceflight Is Getting Cheaper. But It\'s Still Not Cheap Enough.&amp;#160; --&amp;#160; Elon Musk wants us to live in other planets. First he has to make space flight affordable. So he took the fortune he made in Internet start-ups and started his own rocket company.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Financial planner Carl Richards tells us how he got sucked into the &lt;span class="st"&gt;financial&lt;/span&gt; mess just like the rest of us and shares what it taught him.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Gary Loveman used to be an economics professor at Harvard Business School. He studied things like the development of the private sector in Poland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now he runs Ceasars Entertainment Corporation, a giant gambling company. But he still thinks like an academic. He likes to say there are three things that can get you fired from Caesars: Stealing, sexual harassment and running an experiment without a control group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On today\'s show, he tells us how he got from Harvard to Caesars, and explains the surprising results of some of his real-world experiments.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Nevada\'s an economic disaster zone, with the nation\'s highest rate of both unemployment and foreclosures. But a few towns strung along I-80 in the middle of nowhere are doing great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason: They\'re in the middle of Nevada\'s gold mining country, which has boomed as the price of gold has risen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we visit one of those towns. Elko, Nevada is indeed a happy place. But there\'s an undercurrent of anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you get to the edge of town, you can see why: There are all these ghost towns nearby that boomed when the mines were running, then faded to nothing when the gold ran out.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we talk to a guy named Lord Wolfson of Aspley Guise. He\'s a British CEO, and he\'s offering a $400,000 prize to the person who comes up with the best plan for countries to leave the euro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also: The story of another European currency union that fell apart a century ago, and the lessons it holds for the euro.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Today on the podcast, the story of one of the most destructive and mysterious food shortages in recent memory. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most mysterious thing about this shortage of rice: There was more than enough to go around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the epic story of a shortage that wasn\'t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this global caper of good intentions gone wrong, there are shadowy trade deals, corrupt government officials, and warehouses full of rice in a country that didn\'t want it.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we go inside the rooms in Washington where the daily grind of campaign finance &amp;#8212; Congressmen, lobbyists, money &amp;#8212; takes place. At least, we try to go inside the rooms. Several times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we talk to &lt;a href="http://www.getmoneyout.com/a_letter_from_the_executive_director" _mce_href="http://www.getmoneyout.com/a_letter_from_the_executive_director" target="_blank"&gt;Jimmy Williams&lt;/a&gt;, a former lobbyist now working on campaign finance reform. He describes what it\'s like to meet with a Congressman when you\'re a lobbyist and your PAC hasn\'t been donating to the Congressman.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;On today\'s show, we hear the story of a steel-cage match between two economists. The fight has been going on for most of a century now, and it\'s never been more relevant: Keynes versus Hayek.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;It\'s a Deep Read interview with Nicholas Wapshott, the author of the new book Keynes Hayek: The Clash That Defined Modern Economics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Economists love economic growth. It\'s an essential driver of rising living standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But on today\'s show, we wrestle with a question we\'ve heard a lot from our listeners: Is economic growth bad for the planet?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We talk to one economist, Herman Daly, who argues that economic growth is in fact environmentally unsustainable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And we hear from a second, Robert Mendelsohn who says economic growth and a healthy environment can co-exist &amp;#8212; but who argues we should include the effects of pollution in the price of electricity.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;We got our hands on a secret government report outlining what once looked like a potential crisis: The possibility that the U.S. government might pay off its entire debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sounds ridiculous today. But not so long ago, the prospect of a debt-free U.S. was seen as a real possibility with the potential to upset the global financial system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today on the show, we hear from the economist who wrote the report. And we look at how things turned out so, so differently.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Germany and France are a couple tied together by fate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning, they were always at each others\' throats. At last, they realized they weren\'t so different. So they stopped fighting and tied themselves together through &amp;#8212; what else? &amp;#8212; money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On today\'s show, the story of France and Germany &amp;#8212; the relationship on which the fate of Europe depends.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;It seems unlikely that Greece will be able to avoid defaulting on its loans. The real question is how the default will happen &amp;#8212; will it be clean and organized or messy and catastrophic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nightmare scenario Greece most wants to avoid is what happened in Argentina. A deep recession and doomed dollar peg forced Argentina to suspend payments on its debt, leaving its lenders high and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today on the podcast, a cautionary tale for Greece.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we talk to Daniel Yergin, one of the world\'s most influential thinkers about energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We talk about the future of energy in America, and about Yergin\'s new book, &lt;em&gt;The Quest&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yergin\'s previous book, &lt;em&gt;The Prize&lt;/em&gt;, looked at the businessmen and politicians who fought to control oil around the world. &lt;em&gt;The Quest &lt;/em&gt;looks beyond oil to alternative energy. The heroes are the engineers and scientists of the energy world &amp;#8212; the geeks, in other words.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;We went downtown this week to talk to the protesters at Occupy Wall Street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We asked people why they were there. We heard lots of different answers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We went to the big nightly meeting, which lasts for hours. Everybody has something to say. Along the lines of:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should we buy some sleeping bags? Why does that guy get to run the meeting? What if we just buy fabric and make our own sleeping bags?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kind of back and forth, people told us, is the whole point of Occupy Wall Street. It\'s not a movement; it\'s a venue. Standing around, talking about what everybody wants &amp;#8212; this is a model of how the protesters want society to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This being Planet Money, we immediately wondered: Can an entire economy run on group participation? How could that work? It turns out, there\'s an economist named Robin Hahnel who\'s been working on this problem for 40 years. And he has a proposal that he thinks would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He calls it participatory economics.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we visit a place where global economic forces converge: Colo, Iowa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price of farmland in Iowa has doubled in the past few years. People rush to outbid each other at real-estate auctions, and land owners become millionaires in a matter of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We look visit an auction, look at the broader economic picture, and ask an unavoidable question: Is it a bubble?&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;In the 1980s, Satyajit Das worked for a finance company that owned a large stake in an airline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Das got the airline to start making speculative bets on the price of oil. That decision was good for the bottom line: One year, the company made more money from trading than it did from selling tickets on its planes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the long run, Das says on today\'s show, this was part of a much larger shift in the global economy &amp;#8212; and that shift turned out to be a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;For today\'s show, we\'ve collected four Planet Money radio stories that never made it to the podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Slow Motion Bank Run In Europe: Fear can wreck a banking system and cause havoc in an economy. That\'s why the recent worries about big French banks are so important, and so scary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Twist, Explained: Chubby Checker and the Fed\'s latest effort to push down interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Shrinking City Knocks Down Neighborhoods: Youngstown, Ohio, gave up on the idea that a city needs to grow. Now, the city is trying to figure out how to shrink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Indie-Rock Club Behind Omaha\'s $100 Million Boom: A couple college friends decided Omaha needed a music venue. The community they created led developers to remake a whole neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Germany\'s parliament votes next week on whether to go ahead with the next phase of the Greek bailout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On our recent trip to Germany, we talked to lots of people who think parliament should block the bailout. That\'s understandable, given the painful changes Germany went through to get its own house in order a few years back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a surprising number of people told us they do support a bailout &amp;#8212; often for very idealistic reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"We need Greece, we need Spain, we need Italy," a cab driver told us in Frankfurt. "It\'s the ending of war and it\'s the beginning of a new future. It\'s the dream for European peoples."&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On today\'s show: Toxie, Planet Money\'s pet toxic asset, died last year. But we learned recently that she may rise from the grave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And she could theoretically earn us $75,000 &amp;#8212; which is astonishing, given that we bought her for only $1,000. If we do make a profit, all the money will go to charity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toxie was (is!) a mortgage-backed security &amp;#8212; one of the complicated financial instruments that were the heart of the financial crisis. When we bought Toxie, we bought into a pool of thousands of mortgages around the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, that particular pool became the subject of a lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the lawsuit, the mortgages in the pool were a lot shoddier than they were supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;The unemployment rate is disastrously high in the U.S. and much of Europe. But the rate in Germany is just 6 percent &amp;#8212; and it\'s declining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We spent a week in Germany learning their secret recipe. On today\'s show, we hear the how country transformed its labor market a few years back &amp;#8212; and how it still has the scars to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;In a classic game of chicken, two cars race toward each other. The loser is the person who swerves out of the way of the oncoming car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it turns out, chicken is something that game theorists have devoted a lot of thought to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chicken is also a pretty good metaphor for the way Congress handled the debt-ceiling debate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On today\'s show, we talk to Steven S. Smith, a political scientist at Wash U. who studies Congress for a living. He takes us deep inside the debt-ceiling-as-game-of-chicken metaphor. And he explains why the supercommittee may actually work out a deal.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;In Germany, a cab driver can quote you the inflation rate off the top of his head. A big bank has a contest to guess how much a basket of groceries will cost in 10 years. And a newspaper editor says: "There are two things in German psyche that are important: monetary stability, and soccer."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On today\'s show, Caitlin and Zoe report from Germany, where the fear of inflation runs deep. It goes back to the years after World War I, when Germany experienced one of the most catastrophic bouts of hyperinflation in the history of the world &amp;#8212; an economic disaster that helped lay the groundwork for the rise of the Nazis.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On today\'s show: A financial crisis that began with the popping of a huge housing bubble and led to a stock market plunge and a banking crisis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That\'s right. It\'s a show about Japan in the 1990s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We talk to Adam Posen, who argues that the U.S. can learn a lot from Japan\'s mistakes. Posen is an economist at the Peterson institute and the Bank of England.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Everybody\'s worried about Europe\'s economy. What\'s the worst that could happen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bank runs, political riots and falling governments, for a start. Also, the end of the euro as we know it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On today\'s show, David Beim, a finance professor at Colubmia\'s b-school, lays out a worst-case scenario for Europe.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Europe is borrowing money to bail out countries that got in trouble by borrowing too much money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On today\'s Planet Money, Satyajit Das explains that European countries aren\'t actually putting their own money into that big euro-zone bailout fund. Instead, the fund will borrow from investors around the world &amp;#8212; the same investors who are growing wary of lending to a bunch of countries in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What\'s more, the fund will be guaranteed by the countries that use the euro. So the more the fund is used, the more countries that are already struggling &amp;#8212; countries like Spain and Italy &amp;#8212; will be on the hook for potential losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: This podcast originally aired December of \'10.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;With their current leader, Moammar Gadhafi, on the run, Libya needs to start thinking about its next big challenge &amp;#8212; what to do with the massive amount of wealth they as a country possess in oil. It sounds strange to worry about a huge influx of money, but almost all countries that find oil suffer from the natural resource curse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is, however, one notable exception &amp;#8212; Norway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An Iraqi geologist named Farouk al-Kasim advised Norway on how to organize its oil industry, and he is credited with helping it escape the resource curse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today on the podcast, he tells us how he did it.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;The hacker group Anonymous has been grabbing headlines this year for attacking the websites of Sony, the Egyptian government and &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=139877890" _mce_href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=139877890"&gt;Bay Area Rapid Transit &lt;/a&gt;(BART).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike other cybercriminals, the group doesn\'t appear to be hacking these websites for financial gain &amp;#8212; so why do they do it? Why do they spend so much time and effort shutting down these sites?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today on the podcast we talk to some close observers of Anonymous to find out how they operate and what they want.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Switzerland\'s economy is in great shape. Low debt. Low unemployment. Tons of exports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In recent months, this economic strength has created a huge problem for Switzerland. Panicked investors around the world, who see Switzerland as a safe haven, have been buying Swiss francs like mad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That made the value of the franc shoot up &amp;#8212; which in has caused big problems for Switzerland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the show today, we look into the franc\'s crazy rise.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;For years, Estonia played by the rules and did everything exactly the way it was supposed to. It made cut after cut and, just a few months ago, the country finally got what it wanted: It joined euro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the euro\'s troubles, Estonia\'s still doing well. It has the &lt;a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/2-16082011-AP/EN/2-16082011-AP-EN.PDF" _mce_href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/2-16082011-AP/EN/2-16082011-AP-EN.PDF" target="_blank"&gt;highest growth rate&lt;/a&gt; and the lowest public debt of any EU country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s podcast, we talk to Estonia\'s president.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Every day, all around the world, people do business in U.S. dollars &amp;#8212; even when their business has nothing to do with the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dollar is the international language of money. It\'s essential for global trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This provides huge benefits for the United States. U.S. businesses can trade in their own currency. Our government can borrow money more cheaply. Mortgages and student loans are cheaper, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the moment, the dollar\'s dominance seems secure. Safe-haven currencies like the Swiss franc are too small to replace the dollar. And bigger currencies like the euro and the Chinese renminbi have problems of their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we hear about how people use the U.S. dollar Brazil and South Africa. And we talk to an economist who says the dollar\'s days as the world\'s lone reserve currency may be numbered.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;You would never look at a map of the Hudson River, point to the spot where the Tappan Zee Bridge is, and say, "Put the bridge here!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tappan-Zee crosses one of the widest points on the Hudson &amp;#8212; the bridge is more than three miles long. And if you go just a few miles south, the river gets much narrower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our question for today\'s show: Why did they build a three-mile-long bridge when they could have built a much shorter, cheaper bridge nearby?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our search for an answer leads us to a forensic engineer, the Statue of Liberty, and a governor who wanted to be an opera singer.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Italy is in trouble. The country is getting sucked into Europe\'s debt crisis, and leaders around the continent are trying to figure out what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we talk to a few Italians who describe how common tax evasion is in Italy, and how big the unofficial economy is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also talk to Andrew Balls, head of European portfolio management at PIMCO &amp;#8212; a guy whose job is figuring out whether to lend money to Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says Italy isn\'t in such bad shape. Yes, it\'s debt is high. But its annual deficit is small, it didn\'t have a housing crisis and its banks are in decent shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Italy\'s problem is that investors are getting nervous about its neighbors &amp;#8212; Spain, Greece and Portugal. And that tends to spill over.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Patents are supposed to promote innovation. But in the world of software and the Internet, they\'re having precisely the opposite effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tech companies are spending billions of dollars to buy up patents &amp;#8212; not to drive innovation, but to defend themselves from potential lawsuits. There\'s a legal war on in Silicon Valley, and patents are the weapons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We talked about this issue recently on This American Life and All Things Considered. On today\'s podcast, we ask: How much is the patent war costing us? And what does it mean for innovation in America?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For answers, we talk to Jim Bessen, an entrepreneur and researcher, and Eric Maskin, a Nobel-prize-winning-economist.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;" face="Times New Roman" size="3"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Today\'s podcast is a recording of the live show Alex and Adam did in DC this week. In keeping with the vibe of the nation\'s capital, they go big, and talk a lot about "America."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;" face="Times New Roman" size="3"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Key themes: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;" face="Times New Roman" size="3"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Disco destroyed America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;" face="Times New Roman" size="3"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;2.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Now there are two Americas: Broken America and American Dream America&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;" face="Times New Roman" size="3"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;3.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A three-step plan for solving America\'s problems.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Let\'s assume that the U.S. government raises the debt ceiling, and the country keeps paying its bills next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s still very possible that one or more rating agencies will downgrade the country\'s credit rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show we ask: Would a downgrade matter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We revisit a question we asked last year: &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2010/05/_after_the_downgrade_ap.html" _mce_href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2010/05/_after_the_downgrade_ap.html" target="_blank"&gt;How do you rate a country?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we talk to one expert who says a downgrade of America\'s credit rating would make for splashy headlines, but would likely have a relatively small impact. Most of America\'s debt is held by big institutional investors &amp;#8212; and those investors do their own research, and don\'t tend to be swayed much by what rating agencies say.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On today\'s Planet Money, more twists and turns in our story about the more than one billion dollar coins sitting unused in government vaults:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We talk to self-described \'travel hackers\' who use frequent-flier mile credit cards to buy dollar coins and pile up miles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And we learn that the U.S. Mint&amp;#160; \xe2\x80\x94 just today! \xe2\x80\x94 said it would stop letting people use credit cards to buy the coins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also on the show: Why they love U.S. dollar coins in Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Say you\'re a country with a decent-size national debt. Everything\'s going fine: Investors are willing to lend you money at a low interest rate, andyou can pay your bills without too much trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then investors get nervous and start demanding higher interest rates. All of a sudden, you have to devote more and more of your money just to pay off your debt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your economy starts to falter, and investors demand still higher interest rates. Now you\'re really in trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What causes this to happen? Is there some magic threshold that countries cross before they get into trouble?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On today\'s Planet Money, we put that question to Ken Rogoff &amp;#8212; a Harvard economist and an expert on the history of sovereign debt crises. We talk to Rogoff about three countries in particular: Greece, Italy and the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;North Korea relies on charity to feed its starving people. But the country\'s elites like their luxuries &amp;#8212; imported wine, fine china, dancing shoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To buy those things, they need foreign currency. (North Korean currency is worthless outside of North Korea.) To get foreign currency, they need to sell things to the outside world. But North Korea\'s industrial base is a disaster, and the country doesn\'t grow enough food to feed itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s Planet Money, we look at the ways North Korea\'s leaders have managed to keep foreign currency flowing into the country. Their strategies include manufacturing drugs, counterfeiting U.S. dollars, and selling gigantic statues to foreign leaders.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is a new kind of currency. But unlike, say, the dollar or the yen, it\'s not backed by any government. Also, you can\'t hold it in your hand or put it in your pocket; it exists only on computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is supposed to be cash for the Internet age &amp;#8212; anonymous money that anyone can use without using a credit card or going through a bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s Planet Money, try to get our hands on a few bitcoins, which turns out to be harder than it sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We dig into some basic questions that come up when you\'re creating a new currency from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we buy lunch.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we tell the story of a secret battle that\'s been going on for more than a year: Creating the song of the summer, the music industry\'s holy grail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our case study is Rihanna\'s "Man Down." The story starts in the spring of 2010, when Rihanna\'s label flies in songwriters and producers from around the company for a "writing camp" &amp;#8212; a pop-up version of the old hit factories that churned out pop tunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing camp is expensive. But the real money doesn\'t start flowing until after the song is done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Correction: An earlier version of this podcast used the incorrect version of Jennifer Lopez\'s, "I\'m Real."&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;In the seventies and eighties, the Antar family ran Crazy Eddie, a popular electronics chain known for its frenetic commercials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The business was crooked from the start, but the fraud got more serious when the family took the company public in the 1984. In 1987, the Securities and Exchange Commission investigated the family and discovered years of inflated profits and overstated income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, one of the masterminds of the fraud, Eddie\'s cousin Sam Antar, explains how they did it and why it worked for so long.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;div class="postcontent"&gt;&lt;div class="story"&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storylocation"&gt;&lt;div id="res137555820" class="bucketwrap primary"&gt;&lt;div class="spacer"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- END ID="RES137555820" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP PRIMARY" --&gt;&lt;div id="res137555346" class="bucketwrap photo462"&gt;&lt;!-- END CLASS="CAPTIONWRAP" --&gt;Every time the Fed\'s key policy committee met last year, almost everybody in the group agreed on what the Fed should do.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s Planet Money, we talk to the one guy who, meeting after meeting, cast the lone "no" vote: &lt;a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/banks/pres10.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Thomas Hoenig&lt;/a&gt;, president of the Kansas City Fed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoenig thinks the Fed is repeating mistakes of the past, keeping interest rates too low for too long. That risks creating another bubble &amp;#8212; and another crash, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;, &lt;p&gt;On today\'s Planet Money, we travel to a place where people are trying to live without government interference. A place where you can use bits of silver to buy uninspected bacon. A place where a 9-year-old will sell you alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s the 2011 Porcupine Freedom Festival, known to its friends as &lt;a href="http://porcfest.com//" target="_blank"&gt;PorcFest&lt;/a&gt;. It\'s the summer festival for people who think we should return to the gold standard and abolish the IRS.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;On today\'s Planet Money, we visit an underground vault that\'s full of money nobody wants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The money &amp;#8212; bags and bags of dollar coins &amp;#8212; is the result of a 2005 law that requires the U.S. Mint to print a series of coins bearing the likeness of each U.S. president.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The problem is, people don\'t really like dollar coins. So more than 1 billion dollar coins are now sitting, unwanted, in Federal Reserve vaults around the country. By the time the program wraps up in 2016, the Fed will be sitting on 2 billion unwanted coins, according to the Fed\'s own estimates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Unemployment is still dangerously high. But things are looking up for both households and companies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;On today\'s Planet Money, economist Mark &lt;a href="http://www.economy.com/dismal/bios.asp?author=25"&gt;Zandi&lt;/a&gt; says households have been steadily reducing their debt over the past few years. Companies slashed 8.5 million jobs in the recession and their productivity has soared. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;But one thing that Zandi is still worried about: the federal government\'s long-term deficit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;In the 16th century, coffee shops prominently displayed coin boxes with the phrase "to ensure prompt service" written on the side. If you wanted your coffee in a hurry, you dropped a little something extra in the box, and made sure the waitress saw you do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, according to at least one version of history, is where tipping began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But today, we tip after we get served, not before. And, according to one expert we talk to on today\'s podcast, the quality of service we perceive makes a tiny difference in how much we tip. (The weather has a comparable influence on tip size.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to one theory, when you get down to it, we don\'t even tip for good service. We tip because we feel guilty.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;If you know the right people &amp;#8212; and if can get other criminals to vouch for you &amp;#8212; you can go online and buy huge bundles of stolen credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, Planet Money knows the right people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s show, we sit in with Keith Mularski of the FBI. Mularski got so deep into this world that he wound up running a major criminal website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He takes us to a giant online mall for stolen credit cards, where vendors offer discounts for repeat customers and banners advertise hacking and phishing tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;Take a bunch of 3 year olds from poor families. Randomly divide them into two groups, and give one group free access to preschool. Then follow both groups for 40 years. This is what the researchers in the Perry Preschool Program did, starting in the early 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were astonishing. Kids from the preschool group were less likely to be arrested and more likely to have a job. Among those with jobs, those who went to preschool made more money than those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other studies show similar results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today\'s today\'s Planet Money, we talk with James Heckman, a University of Chicago economist. Based on the data from these studies, he argues that using public funds to pay for poor kids to go to preschool actually saves the government money in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: monospace; color: #000000; font-size: medium;"&gt;There\'s a lot of hand waving in economics. People make big-picture arguments and throw around equations, but often there\'s not much good evidence to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MIT economists Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo do experiments to try to figure out how to improve the lot of the world\'s poor. Their goal isn\'t so much to make big, sweeping statements as to find clear answers to specific questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On today\'s Planet Money, we talk to Banerjee and Duflo about their new book, Poor Economics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, On today\'s Planet Money, we hit the streets of Manhattan with economist Tim Harford. In his new book, Adapt, Harford argues that success always starts with failure.Harford takes us on a failure tour of New York. Highlights include a Gutenberg Bible (turns out the Bible business wasn\'t so good to Gutenberg) and the Woolworth Building (Woolworth\'s had some great innovations in its day, but eventually got beat by big-box stores).And perhaps inevitably, we wind up on Wall Street., For hundreds of years, Europe and the U.S. had what Fareed Zakaria calls "the secret sauce" \xe2\x80\x94 a powerful combination of capitalism, the rule of law, individual rights, science, technology and education.Today, the secret sauce has spread around the world. And it\'s driving rapid economic growth in scores of countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America.On today\'s Planet Money, we talk to Zakaria, author of The Post-American World, about what the rise of the developing world means for the U.S., Every political candidate promises to create jobs. But when Scott Walker was campaigning to be the governor of Wisconsin, he put a finer point on it.He promised to create 250,000 jobs during his first term. His strategy for doing that is a familiar one: tax breaks for businesses that make new hires, and for companies that relocate to Wisconsin.We recently traveled to Wisconsin to talk to Scott Walker and businesses around the state. Turns out, it\'s very hard to figure out which jobs were created because of Walker\'s programs, and which would have been created anyway., On today\'s Planet Money, we take a look at the International Monetary Fund.What does the IMF actually do? Does the world need the IMF? And what do the charges against Dominique Strauss-Kahn mean for the future of the institution?, Jonathan Coulton is a rock star for geeks. He used to work as a computer programmer. But now he writes songs about white-collar zombies and lovesick programmers.He doesn\'t have a record label, but he makes about $500,000 a year from his music. He tours, licenses his music, and sells songs and merch from his bare-bones website.On today\'s Planet Money, we talk to Coulton about his work.Jacob Ganz and Frannie Kelley from NPR Music are our special-guest co-hosts. The core question: Is Coulton a fluke, or is he a new model of how to make a living as a musician?, Last fall, we embarked on our latest adventure in investment journalism: We bought a gold coin.On today\'s show, we sell that coin, and find out whether we made or lost money (the question is more complicated than it sounds).And we try to figure out whether we\'re in the middle of a gold bubble., On today\'s Planet Money: The legend of the national debt. Where the debt came from, what happened the one time we paid it all off, and why Congress created the debt ceiling in the first place., On today\'s Planet Money, we talk to Ali Tarhouni.He fled Libya 40 years ago after speaking out against Moammar Gadhafi. "I was given a choice to leave the country or go to jail," he says. His name wound up on a Gadhafi hit list in the 1980s.His life settled down over the years, though, and he landed a job teaching microeconomics at the University of Washington. But when the civil war started in Libya, Tarhouni returned home and quickly became the finance minister for the anti-Gadhafi forces. His job, among other things, is to figure out how to get money for the rebels., On today\'s Planet Money: The economics of the Middle Ages.Knights are extortionists. Guilds knock down your house if you don\'t play by their rules. And you have to wait until the black death kills a third of Europe before anything changes.Tough times., There was a brief moment \xe2\x80\x94 post-Friendster, pre-Facebook \xe2\x80\x94 when MySpace was a big deal.How did that happen? And why was the moment so brief?The answer involves porn, spyware, and total ignorance. On today\'s podcast we talk to Julia Angwin, author of Stealing Myspace: The Battle to Control the Most Popular Website in America.Note: The interview originally aired in a podcast in August of \'09., It\'s called "Iceland" for a reason. Polar bears sometimes wind up there floating by on chunks of ice. In the winter, there are only a few hours of daylight each day.Reykjavik feels like you took a European city \xe2\x80\x94 coffee shops, fancy cars, orderly streets \xe2\x80\x94 and put it on the moon.Which raises a question: How did a barren, icy island become a thriving, modern economy?The short answer: Fish, energy and books., Remember that school we visited in Haiti last year? The one without a schoolhouse?After we did a story on the school, listeners donated $3,000. The principal thought it was enough to build a schoolhouse. But, as we reported last fall, that money was only enough for a foundation and some concrete blocks.We thought that would be the end of the story. Then we got an email from a listener named Tim Myers. On today\'s show, we talk to Tim about what he learned on a recent trip to Haiti \xe2\x80\x94 and we hear how much he thinks it will cost to build the school.Also on the podcast, a very special Planet Money Indicator: A decade of U.S. home prices, sung as opera. For more on that project, read our post from earlier this afternoon., The very rich have planes and helicopters and yachts. They can go wherever they want, whenever they want.On today\'s Planet Money, we pose a question being debated in state capitals around the country: Do the rich flee high-tax states?, Iceland \xe2\x80\x94 the whole country \xe2\x80\x94 has about as many people as Lexington, Kentucky. It also has its own currency, the Krona.So during the boom, Iceland\'s banks got rich by going abroad \xe2\x80\x94 by borrowing and lending in euros to customers around Europe.When the crisis hit, that led to a big problem: Iceland ran out of foreign money., On today\'s show: The Planet Money team heads for Iceland with the help of Baldur Hedinsson, our Icelandic intern.We get there just before the big election, when the people will vote to decide whether to pick up the tab for mistakes bankers made before the financial crisis., Lots of fancy economists write about the economics of illegal drugs. Here\'s a paper from a Harvard guy. Here\'s another co-authored by a couple Chicago guys.One thing missing from those papers: Actual drug dealers.So for today\'s podcast, we run some economic theory by Freeway Rick Ross (pictured), who was one of the biggest crack dealers in LA in the \'80s and \'90s., Have we got a deal for you!An entire show about coupons, Groupons, and the economic history of cheapskates.Act now, and we\'ll give you 40 minutes worth of economic wisdom in just 25 minutes., Every politician promises to create jobs. On today\'s Planet Money, we ask: What does that mean?, As you may have heard, it\'s Fannie and Freddie week on Planet Money.On Tuesday\'s show, we described the rise and fall of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Today, we try to figure out what comes next. This raises a central question: Should taxpayers be on the hook when people take out mortgages and don\'t pay them back?, It\'s Fannie and Freddie week on Planet Money!They\'re two of the strangest companies in U.S. history \xe2\x80\x94 and their bailouts cost taxpayers more than the bailouts of AIG, GM, Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs combined.On today\'s Podcast, we tell the story of the rise and fall of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac., Should NPR receive federal funding? On today\'s Planet Money, we try to look at the question through the cold, hard lens of economics.We go back to an idea we covered in a podcast last year: public goods.Here\'s how an expert defined a public good on that show:    "...something that we all need that will make our lives better, but the market will not and cannot provide..."Sounds simple enough so far. But as we wade into the details, things start to get murky., The crisis in Japan is a horrible human tragedy. Is it also an economic disaster?There are big, short-term economic problems. On today\'s show, a man who works at a major Japanese truck and bus manufacturer describes widespread factory closures and disruptions in the supply of parts.But in the long-term, for all of the suffering, Japan\'s economy is likely to bounce back from the disaster., On today\'s Planet Money, we read the thing you\'ve never read: your credit card agreement. And we pose the question: Does it really have to be so long and complicated?We talk to a lawyer who says yes, it really does have to be so long and complicated. We talk to a consultant whose job is to make it simpler. And we ask 4th graders to read a credit-card agreement and tell us what they think., (RERUN)We look at the world through the eyes of Matt LeBlanc, an efficiency expert (or lean expert), who runs around with a stopwatch and equations, trying to figure out how to eliminate waste in our economy. He finds it everywhere. LeBlanc says sometimes people love him and thank him. And sometimes not., In their latest five-year plan, China\'s leaders set a remarkable goal: Slower economic growth. It\'s a recognition of problems like environmental damage and rising inequality that have come with rapid growth., Does more money bring more happiness? Economists have been arguing over the question for decades (and everybody else has been arguing over it forever).Economist Justin Wolfers of the Wharton School, has spent hours poring over happiness surveys from 155 countries across the globe, and he says the data is clear: more money means more happiness.On today\'s Planet Money, Wolfers talks about his research and explains its implications for public policy., When Reading, Pennsylvania fell on hard times a few years back, city officials sold off a lake. They raised property taxes and refinanced their debt. But it wasn\'t enough: The city couldn\'t get its budget deficit under control.So, halfway through his second term, the mayor decided he couldn\'t deal with the problem. He threw in the towel and basically asked the state of Pennsylvania to declare Reading a financial disaster area.On today\'s Planet Money, we visit Reading to find out what happened next., In Spain, if you don\'t pay your mortgage, the bank can come after you for everything \xe2\x80\x94 your car, your wages, whatever.In many parts of the U.S., it\'s not like that. If you don\'t pay your mortgage, the bank can take the house back, but that\'s it.On today\'s podcast, we ask: Which system is better?, When Egyptians rose up against their government, the Egyptian military protected them. When Libyans rose up against their government, the military started shooting.On today\'s Planet Money, we try to figure out why the responses were so different., On today\'s Planet Money, we hear the words of ordinary man \xe2\x80\x94 Benjamin Roth, a lawyer in Youngstown, Ohio \xe2\x80\x94 trying to come to grips with the Great Depression.Benjamin\'s son, Daniel, joins us to read excerpts from his father\'s diary and tell us the back story., Franklin Delano Roosevelt ignores the advice of America\'s big-name economists \xe2\x80\x94 and listens instead to a guy who helped take care of the trees on his estate.Montagu Norman, head of the Bank of England, gets a coded message at a critical moment \xe2\x80\x94 and completely misunderstands what it means.On today\'s Planet Money: The gold standard and the Great Depression., It\'s gold standard week on Planet Money!On today\'s show, we visit the charming curmudgeon and respected finance writer James Grant. He says we should go back on the gold standard.His basic argument: Under the gold standard, money holds its value. Central banks can\'t create (or destroy) money at a whim., "At bottom, I\'m not all that interested in money," Michael Lewis tells us on today\'s Planet Money.On the show, we talk about the long arc of Lewis\'s work.In the \'80s, he wrote a book about the people who created mortgage-backed securities. Last year, he described people who bet against mortgage backed securities and got rich when they collapsed in the financial crisis. In his next book, he\'ll profile some of the places that got hit particularly hard in the crisis., In the big finance bill passed last year, Congress left lots of details for the regulators to hammer out.On today\'s Planet Money, we see what all that hammering looks like. We sit in on the bank regulators\' book club, and we visit a public hearing full of finance-industry people.Also on the show: Why would a Burger King franchise in Arkansas be interested in derivatives regulation? Bloomberg News has the answer., So far, the Egyptian military has largely sided with the protesters in the streets of Cairo. This is not only because the military supports the people; it\'s also because the military sells the people lots of stuff.On today\'s Planet Money, we look at the Egyptian military\'s deep business ties to everything from dishwashers to resort hotels. And we consider how those ties influence how the military responds to the crisis., On today\'s podcast, we talk with Nicholas Phillipson, the author of "Adam Smith: An Enlightened Life."Besides learning about the intellectual and political world Smith inhabited, we hear a bit about the man himself \xe2\x80\x94 how he wasn\'t just awkward but a bit of a mama\'s boy., This was supposed to be a very exciting week for Planet Money: The week the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission came out with the single, definitive story, explaining the financial crisis once and for all.That didn\'t happen. Instead, the commission fractured along partisan lines, and we got three separate stories. On today\'s podcast, we talk to commissioners from both sides, and we find that they agree on an awful lot. But in the end, they can\'t agree on the moral of the story. And that winds up being a big difference., On today\'s podcast, we consider a plan to dramatically grow the US economy. The plan has nothing to do with banks, stimulus, tax cuts or the Federal Reserve. Instead, the plan focuses entirely on \xe2\x80\x94 public school teachers.Economist Eric Hanushek has been researching education and the economy for four decades. In a recent study, he tried to put a monetary value on good teaching., Almost half of all the duties collected in the U.S. are on apparel or footwear, and the laws that govern the importing of these goods are extremely complicated. We\'ve talked about tariffs before on the podcast, but now that we\'ve got our own Planet Money t-shirt in the works, we\'re paying much closer attention. Since it\'s likely at least some part of our t-shirt will be made abroad, we wanted to know exactly what to expect.On today\'s podcast, we consult with trade lawyer Michael Cone, and visit the lab where customs officials check to make sure importers are following the rules., In the last few months, we\'ve done stories about how actions taken by Ireland, Greece, Spain, and even a European bailout fund have threatened the future of the entire Eurozone.On today\'s show, we bring you the story of one country that played by the rules and did everything exactly the way they were supposed to. One country that made cut after cut, after cut in hopes of gaining access to the special club of the euro -- Estonia.Estonia officially surrendered its kroons and moved to the euro this week so we figured it was a perfect time to ask the country\'s president if he thought all those sacrifices were worth it., The 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage -- the bedrock of American home ownership -- is a weird loan.In an ordinary market, you\'d have to pay a really high interest rate to get a 30-year fixed, if you could get it at all. Only the intervention of the government -- and the creation of Fannie Mae -- turned the loan into America\'s plain-vanilla mortgage.On today\'s Planet Money, Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera (authors of All the Devils Are Here, a book on the financial crisis) walk us through the 30-year-fixed and the history of Fannie and Freddie. And they talk about where we go from here., Last month, we asked you to participate in our economics experiment. On today\'s podcast, we dive into the results.Everybody who participated saw the same three animal videos. But people were randomly assigned to two different groups. One group was asked to pick the animal they thought was the cutest. The other group was asked to pick the animal that they thought was most likely to be voted cutest by other participants., We used to talk about the G-7 -- the world\'s seven biggest economic powerhouses. Every so often, the leaders of the G-7 countries would get together and hash out the important issues facing the global economy.That grew to become the G-20, which included big players in the developing world (China, India, Brazil). In the heat of the financial crisis, the G-20 made a good show of cooperation.But as the crisis has faded, so has the cooperation. What\'s left is a world where there\'s no clear economic leadership. That creates a new set of problems, David Gordon says on today\'s Planet Money.Gordon, research director at the consulting firm Eurasia Group, calls this new world "G-Zero.", Spain\'s financial system is in trouble. Too many banks made too many bad loans. Part of the solution, the government has decided, is to consolidate -- to have relatively healthy banks buy relatively sick ones.On today\'s Planet Money, we meet Angel Borges. He\'s a banking consultant in Spain, and he\'s played the role of merger matchmaker for many of the regional banks known as cajas. But the mergers haven\'t been particularly smooth or efficient. For more on Spain\'s cajas, listen to our podcast from last week (#239)., The fate of Spain\'s economy may lie in a couple dozen savings banks called cajas de ahorros. These banks hold more than 50 percent of Spanish bank deposits and many are in danger of failing.On today\'s Planet Money, we explain why these tiny Spanish banks pose a threat to the European and global economies., Gift-giving makes economists crazy. It\'s so inefficient!So we wondered: Is there a way to make the holiday season both more efficient and more joyful?On today\'s Planet Money, we try to answer that question by conducting a wildly unscientific experiment. We go into a seventh-grade classroom and give a bunch of kids some small gifts -- candy, raisins, fig newtons.Then we ask them how much they value what they got, and if they can think of a way to make everyone better off, without buying any more gifts. They quickly arrive at a solution: trade.Behold, the power of economics!, Economists love to point out that the simplest products -- a pencil, say -- are the results of an incredibly complex system.On today\'s podcast, we talk to the economist Tim Harford, who once marveled at the beauty and complexity hidden in a cup of cappuccino. But now, he questions if that complexity is always good., Today on the podcast, why a horrible economy can be really good for pursuing your dreams.We talk to listener, Becky Mumaw, who wrote to us when we asked people to share how they think they\'ll fair in the post-crisis economy.Becky and her boyfriend Nick Westervelt had dreamed of being farmers one day, and recently, they made that dream come true by purchasing a farm in upstate New York.The farm\'s former owners had a food concession business that failed during the recession, so Becky and Nick were able to buy the land fairly cheaply. The downturn in the job market also made it easier for Becky and Nick to pursue the farm. Without many good job prospects, they felt comfortable walking away from the career paths they would have pursued in good economic times.But that\'s not the case for everyone. For some of Becky and Nick\'s friends -- a dancer and a painter -- the recession has made life very hard., A few months back, we bought a tiny gold coin. The idea was to understand gold and its role in the history of money. That coin got us thinking about this really basic question: What is money?The question led us to Yap -- a tiny island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, where for hundreds of years people used giant stone discs as a form of money. As it turns out, those stone discs say a lot about the meaning of money.If you don\'t believe us, just ask Milton Friedman., The world\'s biggest economies spend a summer plotting in secret, over French wine, to make the dollar worth much, much less.You guessed it: The Plaza Accord!On today\'s Planet Money, we tell the story of the 1985 deal -- and reflect on what it says about today\'s currency wars, and about government efforts to set the value of money., Europe is borrowing money to bail out countries that got in trouble by borrowing too much money. On today\'s Planet Money, Satyajit Das explains that European countries aren\'t actually putting their own money into that trillion-dollar bailout fund. Instead, the fund will borrow from investors around the world -- the same investors who are growing wary of lending to a bunch of countries in Europe., Earlier this year, we reported on l\'Artibonite, a rice-growing region in Haiti. The people there were suffering because an influx of free rice from foreign aid groups destroyed the market for their crop.Listeners responded, donating some $3,000 to support a school that figured prominently in the story. That\'s about 10 years of wages for the average Haitian.The principal, Enselm Simpliste, thought he could use the $3,000 to build a schoolhouse.We recently visited the school to see how things were coming along. The news is bad: All the money has been spent, and all there is to show for it is a foundation, some concrete blocks and some rock and sand., In the teeth of the financial crisis, the government of Ireland decided to issue a blanket guarantee, promising to make good on all the debts of all its banks.That guarantee, we know now, has worked out very badly for Ireland.On today\'s Planet Money, we hear the story of how Ireland\'s decision also had huge consequences for Europe and the U.S., Okay we admit it, we stole our idea to make a t-shirt and report every part of the process from Pietra Rivoli, who wrote the book, The Travels of a T-shirt in a Global Economy.Pietra followed the story of her t-shirt across three continents and along the way she learned about the many factors outside the market that impacted its production., Out of all the elements on earth, why does gold hold such a privileged place in human history? Is it just a fluke, or is there something more fundamental going on?On today\'s Planet Money, we try to find out., According to a recent report  from the Social Security Board of Trustees, the program\'s trust funds have $2.5 trillion in them. But there\'s an argument about whether or not that $2.5 trillion actually exists. So in today\'s podcast, we take a look at just what are the Social Security "trust funds.", What should the government pay for?On today\'s Planet Money, we pose that question to Charlie Wheelan, author of the book Naked Economics, and recent Congressional candidate (he lost; here\'s his underwater ad).He gives us the econ 101 answer: The government should definitely pay for something if it\'s a public good., For two years, we\'ve waited for someone from the financial world to apologize for their role the financial crisis. On today\'s Planet Money, Jacob Kosoff steps up. Kosoff used to work as an economist for Freddie Mac, and his job was to promote homeownership. He managed an online calculator designed to help people determine whether to rent or buy a house. But Kosoff says there\'s a big problem with the calculator -- and he\'s sorry he didn\'t work harder to fix it., The economy won\'t be healthy until the housing market bottoms out. It may take another year.On today\'s Planet Money, economist Mark Zandi tells us what it will take for the bust to end -- and sketches out housing\'s profound influence on the broader economy., We need four bales of cotton to make the Planet Money t-shirt. On today\'s Planet Money, we go shopping in Texas and Brazil -- and find a long-running trade war. We meet a Brazilian who took on the world\'s largest superpower, a Texas cotton farmer who\'s tired of hearing the Brazilians complain, and a guy named Renato -- a.k.a. Retaliation Master.Music: Johnny Cash\'s "Cotton Fields", Back in May, we announced on the podcast that we\'d be making a Planet Money t-shirt. Then we got swamped in the details. This week, though, we\'re back with two podcasts on the t-shirt project. Today, we look at the economics of design. And we explain why ripping off other people\'s fashion ideas is a good -- and, for the moment, perfectly legal -- strategy for us to pursue.Music: Avett Brothers\' "Kick Drum Heart", On today\'s Planet Money, we go shopping with George Minichello.George is one of hundreds of federal employees who goes to stores all over the country and record the prices of thousands of different things. A bag of romaine lettuce. A boy\'s size-14 collared shirt made of 97 percent cotton. A loaf of white bread.Their work drives the consumer price index, a key economic indicator known to its friends as CPI. The index measures inflation in the U.S., and it influences everything from Social Security checks to the price of school lunches to how big your raise will be next year., How does a guy whose mom is a heroin addict -- a guy who drops out of high school, has a kid, and starts working a minimum-wage job at a fast-food restaurant -- climb out of poverty? On today\'s podcast, we hear the answer from Katherine Newman, a sociologist who studied 300 fast-food restaurant workers in Harlem in the early \'90s., On today\'s Planet Money, we make a radical change in our investment strategy: We buy gold. And we find that our new investment raises some unsettling questions. Music: Dispatch\'s "Flying Horses.", On today\'s Planet Money, we hear from Tim Taylor, an economist who starts out his econ classes with this question. He says about 2/3 of the students choose B.There\'s no right answer here. But, Taylor says, there is an implicit lesson., The U.S. is the world\'s biggest manufacturer -- way bigger than China, according to the National Association of Manufacturing. So why doesn\'t it feel that way? On today\'s Planet Money, we visit two factories to find out.Music: V.V. Brown\'s "Quick Fix", On today\'s Planet Money, we meet a single mother who makes $16,000 a year -- and who managed to fund a vacation at a Caribbean resort with an interest-free loan from one of the world\'s largest banks.Edith Calzado gets credit cards with teaser zero-percent interest rates -- then transfers her balance before the rate ticks up. She signs up for store cards to get discounts -- then pays off her bill on time. She gets food stamps and lives in subsidized housing. Her son is doing well in school.She may be the single most successful and productive beneficiary of government assistance you\'ll ever meet.But when she talks about people on traditional welfare -- cash that\'s given to mothers with babies -- she sounds like Ronald Reagan attacking welfare queens, Brazil\'s economy is booming now, but for most of the 20th century it was an economic mess. In the 80s and 90s, Inflation was so high that grocery stores were raising their prices every day. So the government brought in in four economists who had been talking to each other for years about how to fix Brazil\'s inflation problem. Their solution: Create a currency that doesn\'t exist. No coins, no bills.Music: Hey Marseilles\' "Rio.", An animated funeral for Toxie, our toxic asset., Is it OK to raise money from rich investors, who expect to make a profit? Muhammad Yunus, the father of microfinance, says no. If you have investors who expect profits, you\'ll ultimately turn into something more like a loan-shark than a do-gooder. Vikram Akula, founder of SKS Microfinance -- a company that had an IPO earlier this year -- says raising money from profit-seeking investors is the only way to spread microfinance quickly around the world. On today\'s Planet Money, Akula and Yunus hash out their differences.Music: Stars\' "Your Ex-Lover Is Dead", We are gathered here to day to commemorate the passing of Toxie, Planet Money\'s toxic asset.The first to speak will be Wit Solberg, the investor who helped us buy Toxie. Wit also invested in Toxie -- and, like us, he lost more than half his investment.We\'ll also hear from Samir Noriega, an analyst who served as Toxie\'s doctor.  He was the first to diagnose Toxie back in April and to name the cause of death this week:  home loan modifications. In other words, lenders helping homeowners out and forgiving debt., Last week, we had a socialist, Richard Wolff, on to explain what Socialism actually is and what a true Socialist government might look like these days.  Today, two libertarians explain what libertarianism is and what they like and don\'t like about the Democrats and Republicans., Despite what you may have heard, Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats aren\'t socialists. And the top Republicans in Washington aren\'t free-market libertarians. But given how freely everybody\'s throwing those terms around these days, we\'re wading in to get a deeper understanding of what they really mean. On today\'s Planet Money, we talk to an actual socialist -- Richard Wolff, professor emeritus at the University of Massachusetts -- about socialism. Coming next week: Libertarianism.Music: Billy Bragg\'s "The Red Flag.", A few years back, when the housing market was going nuts, people didn\'t know we were in the middle of a gigantic bubble.That, of course, is how we wound up with Toxie, Planet Money\'s pet toxic asset.On today\'s podcast, we travel back to 2005, the year Toxie was created from thousands of home mortgages.And we talk to Lisa Liberator-Kinney, who bought a home in Bradenton, Florida during the bubble -- and whose mortgage wound up in our toxic asset., We got all excited about school starting up again. So on today\'s podcast, we reached out to a bunch of econ profs and asked them to give us their best stuff -- the stories they tell to try to hook their students on economics.Music: Magic Bullets\' "Lying Around.", Today, we hear from Satyajit Das, a risk consultant and author of Traders, Guns &amp; Money: Knowns and Unknowns in the Dazzling World of Derivatives. Das\' book was written before the financial crisis, but if you read it when it came out, not much of what happened during the crisis would have surprised you. It\'s a very detailed, very cynical account of what actually goes on inside Wall Street banks., On today\'s Planet Money, listeners suggest ways to cut the federal budget -- and experts evaluate their suggestions. Among the ideas: Get rid of manned space flight, cut "welfare and warfare," and stop paying Social Security benefits to high earners. This is the first of several stories we\'ll be doing in the coming months on government spending, and the way things like earmarks, subsidies and entitlements affect our lives.Music: Gomez\'s "How We Operate", Over the past few years, the Fed bought $1.25 trillion* of mortgage bonds.It was a big move for the central bank, intended to prop up the housing market. But in all the discussion about the program, we never heard anybody explain how you actually buy all those bonds.On today\'s Planet Money, we go inside the Fed to find out.The answer involves a plain room with four small cubicles, a Nerf hoops net and a table-tennis trophy., Financial trickery! Self-dealing! CDOs! On today\'s podcast, we return to the last days of the housing bubble. Our story: A group of bankers knew there were serious problems in the market for subprime mortgage investments. But rather than wind the business down, they sped it up -- prolonging the bubble, and ultimately making the crisis worse.Music from The Delays\' "Long Time Coming.", On today\'s Planet Money, we talk to people who\'ve been inside those rooms. And we unpack the latest Basel rules -- regulations that are supposed to apply to banks around the world, and that are due later this year.(Spoiler alert: They\'ll probably make the system safer. But they won\'t end financial crises.), It\'s really, really hard to create the right kind of economic incentives -- even if you\'re a professional economist, and all you\'re trying to do is teach your kids to use the toilet.On today\'s Planet Money, we talk to Joshua Gans, an economist at the University of Melbourne -- and his 11-year-old daughter. He explains the system he constructed and rules he enforced. But like tiny Wall-Street bankers, the kids figured out how to work the system for maximum advantage., Today, we hear from Nassim Taleb, the former Wall Street trader who published a book called the Black Swan back in 2007.The book argues that most economic models fail because they don\'t take into account rare, high-impact events that wind up driving history. (Taleb calls these events Black Swans.) The argument came out looking pretty good after the 2008 financial crisis.Earlier this year, a new edition of the book came out, with a new section called "On Robustness &amp; Fragility." Among other things, the new section includes a prescription for withstanding a Black Swan.The short version: Get rid of debt., On today\'s Planet Money, we leap 30 years into the future, a time, if current trends persist, when China\'s economy is bigger than America\'s.What does it look like?We\'re watching Chinese reality shows dubbed into English, and taking life-saving drugs invented by Chinese scientists. We\'re exporting more goods to China\'s growing middle class.The yuan probably has not supplanted the dollar as the world\'s reserve currency (and even if it has, it\'s not the end of the world).And Chinese people are still much poorer, on average, than people in the U.S., The network neutrality debate, which has been burning up the comments section of many a tech blog for several years now, hit mainstream media this week when Verizon and Google released a joint proposal for new legislation regulating the internet. The debate really boils down to the economics of the internet.  How it operates, and who pays. On today\'s podcast, we put on flame-resistant suits and dive in.  We talk to two economists to find out what net neutrality will mean for the future of the internet., Right at this very moment, you and I, and the rest of the country are participating in one of the great economics experiments of all time. An experiment to test whether John Maynard Keynes\' prescription for how to get out of a global depression actually works. The Obama administration calls it the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, you probably know it as the $787 billion stimulus package.Keynes wrote about the idea of stimulus in his 1936 book, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money.His theory simply put, was this -- sometimes economies go into a recession and they can\'t get out, they get stuck in a kind of recession whirlpool and the best way to get them out is a swift kick by the government in the form of spending. The idea being that if the people aren\'t spending money, the government needs to borrow it from them and then spend it for them.Today on the podcast, we try to answer the question was Keynes right? Did the $787 billion stimulus package worked?, Playing Monopoly is one of a child\'s earliest opportunities to manage their own "money" and learn basic economic concepts. As such, it is frequently cited as an effective teaching tool. Daniel Hamermesh, professor of economics at the University of Texas at Austin , and a self-described "monopoly veteran," uses it at the college level, to teach his intro economics classes about marginal benefit. He explains it this way, when you put the first 2 or 3 houses on a property in Monopoly, you get big increases in rent, but adding house number 4 and a hotel only bring dwindling returns. He\'s also got his own strategy for playing at home with his grandkids "the green properties are losers" and "never buy the utilities."If Daniel Hamermesh is Monopoly\'s economist champion, Russ Roberts of George Mason University, is its economist defector. While Russ admits to playing as a child, these days he says the only time it\'s played in his house, is when he wants to teach his kids "how bad" its lessons are. In a 2006 Morning Edition commentary, Roberts said about the game "...only Marxists look at the world of capitalism the way the game of Monopoly does, as an unrelentingly gloomy system of exploitation where the rich eventually wear everyone else down."On today\'s podcast, we pit Daniel Hamermesh and Russ Roberts against Alex Blumberg and Robert Smith in a heavily edited game of Monopoly to find out what lessons the game has to offer and who has the best strategy for winning., Historians say it was the spring waters that brought President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to Warm Springs, Georgia, in the 1920\'s. FDR, who suffered from polio, was said to have used the springs for physical therapy. Around town however, another story circulates, FDR was fond of the region\'s moonshine.On today\'s Planet Money, we travel to Warm Springs to find out if the rumors are true. Did FDR really buy moonshine during Prohibition? Did he really violate the Constitution he had sworn to protect?In our quest for truth, we meet the daughter of FDR\'s favorite fiddle player and an economist, who explains how Prohibition, a divisive moral issue, became a celebrated business stimulus plan., What\'s the price of a pelican? The total for a turtle? The dollars for a dolphin?  Its not a philosophical question anymore. The BP oil spill killed hundreds of these animals, and the Feds want to make darn sure that BP pays the total bill. But coming up with a precise economic value for wildlife has stymied economists and scientists for decades. There\'s no market for most of these animals. No catalog for endangered species. No eBay or Craigslist for migratory birds.That\'s not going to stop us from trying, though. Today on the podcast, we come up with 5 different ways to put a pricetag on a pelican., Recently we learned from a group of reporters at the Sarasota Herald-Tribune that one of the mortgages in Toxie, our toxic asset, was part of a real-estate scheme being investigated by the FBI. It\'s a scheme that allegedly involves $200 million in fraudulent loans.So we traveled to Florida to find out how the scheme worked. The reporters there told us it all centered around a man named Craig Adams, who was flipping houses back and forth among a circle of friends and business associates. The people in the circle would buy homes for higher and higher prices, taking out larger and larger loans from the bank and then divide that money amongst themselves., Our latest payment from Toxie was supposed to arrive this week. Once again, we got zero dollars and zero cents.Our little toxic asset isn\'t quite dead yet. But it\'s been months since we\'ve seen a payment.So before she\'s gone, we figured we\'d try to learn what she\'s all about -- not just loan-to-value ratios and unpaid mortgages, but actual houses and actual people. People who aren\'t paying us back., Max Marion-Spencer is 18 and unemployed -- despite having applied for jobs at Quizno\'s, McDonald\'s, Arby\'s, Food Lion and Dollar General.His grandmother, Alice Terry, is 62, and works as a high school teacher.On today\'s Planet Money, Max and Alice join us to interview for a fake job.Fake-job title: Human manifestation of an economic trend.The trend: In the U.S. workforce, teenagers are now outnumbered by people who are 65 or older., A decade ago, Philip Morris commissioned a study that found smokers in the Czech Republic were actually saving society money.A big part of the savings: Smoking tends to kill people while they\'re still young, saving society the long-term costs of caring for them as they get older.Perhaps not surprisingly, this finding blew up in the company\'s face.On today\'s Planet Money, we tell the story of the study. And we look more broadly at the economics of this stuff., That big finance bill everybody\'s been talking about since forever is about to become law.But as it turns out, the bill doesn\'t answer some fundamental questions. How much money will banks have to hold as a safety cushion? Unclear.Which big companies (besides banks) will be subject to new regulations? The bill doesn\'t say.On today\'s podcast, we talk to Rep. Barney Frank, one of the guys whose name is on bill.He argues that Congress has to leave lots of issues to the regulators\' discretion. And, he says, the bill\'s effectiveness is largely in the hands of future leaders."In democracies, there are no guarantees," he told us., On today\'s Planet Money: the criminal underworld, the nature of human happiness, and the economics of LeBron James.With special guest Mike Pesca, insight from Tyler Cowen, and a Planet Money Indicator on China\'s currency., On today\'s Planet Money, we meet Jonathan Bush -- former ambulance driver, former co-owner of a birthing center, and cousin of a former President of the United States.More to the point: He\'s also the CEO of athenahealth, a public company that doctors pay to manage their billing.Medical billing is ridiculously complicated. Each insurance company has its own set of rules. The industry still seems stuck in the \'80s in some ways: The average doctor gets about 1,000 faxes each month, according to Bush.In some ways, health care just is complicated. Still, some insurers seem to make it more complicated than it has to be.Athenahealth deals with more than 1,700 different insurance companies. And it\'s put together a "Pain-in-the-Butt index" that ranks insurers based on how hard it is to deal with them, First, we hear from Yvrose Jean Baptiste, the Haitian businesswoman left destitute by the earthquake.When we first met her in February, all she had to her name was a tub of chicken necks she was selling for a few pennies each. Now, she has money in the bank and her own stall in a bustling market. Then: mangoes. Earlier this year on This American Life we told the story of how hard it was to build a little place where farmers could wash and store their mangoes.We thought it would never happen. But -- right after that story aired -- construction began. A local leader even convinced the young men in the village to dig up 27 miles of unused pipe - for free - and move it so that it can supply water to the center., Mervyn\'s a tire repairman in a Kingston slum. He took scrap parts from an old Lincoln and turned them into a machine that retreads tires. It works great.Mervyn\'s shop is a shack, and he\'s totally outside the formal economy. If he wanted to get a loan -- say, to expand his business -- he\'d be out of luck.Michael Lee-Chin\'s a billionaire. He\'s the chairman of a big Jamaican bank, a guy who flies in on a helicopter for an interview.On today\'s Planet Money, we talk to both guys. And we explain why it\'s so rare for guys like Mervyn to get loans from guys like Lee-Chin., We wade into the economics of the art world to find out why a dead shark costs $12 million, and a photo of steel wool that looks like a tornado costs $1,265. Plus, we talk about some of the last-minute changes to the big finance bill that cleared a conference committee today., Today on the Planet Money Deep Read, we talk with Raghuram Rajan, former chief economist at the IMF, about his new book Fault Lines: How Hidden Fractures Still Threaten The World Economy., Alex Blumberg reports from Jamaica, where low-tech tomato farmers struggle to compete., You remember the natural resource curse. It\'s the idea that being rich in natural resources -- oil, gold, lithium, whatever -- can actually harm a country\'s economic development.On today\'s Planet Money, we talk to a couple economists who are pushing what sounds like a simple way to break the curse: Give the money directly to the people.They recently took the idea on a road show to Africa, to try to convince a couple oil-rich countries to give it a try. It didn\'t go so well., The people selling rice in Port-au-Prince say business is terrible. So we travel to l\'Artibonite, Haiti\'s rice country, to learn more.There are lots of problems with Haiti\'s rice market. Since the earthquake, free rice from foreign aid groups has made it harder for Haitian farmers to sell what they grow.Even before the earthquake, they had a hard time competing with foreign rice, which is produced using high-output, modern farming techniques that aren\'t available in Haiti., Economists have been writing for decades about "regulatory capture" -- the idea that regulators are "captured" by the industry they\'re supposed to be watching over, and wind up serving industry\'s interests.In a famous paper published in 1971, the economist George Stigler wrote:...as a rule, regulation is acquired by the industry and is designed and operated primarily for its benefit.That notion still holds sway.In the years leading up to the savings and loan crisis of the late \'80s and early \'90s, for example, the industry persuaded Congress to make the regulations more lenient. A decade later, Congress went along with another industry push to leave many derivatives largely unregulated, and to allow consolidation in the finance industry., On today\'s Planet Money, we discuss high-frequency trading, in which people program computers to buy and sell stocks in quick succession under certain, pre-defined circumstances. The idea is to profit from fleeting changes in the price of a stock. High-frequency traders include big banks and tiny little companies. And they\'re all trying to be even faster than each other.A few years back, all the high-frequency traders were trying to get a one-millisecond edge over everybody else. Today, they\'re angling for a one-microsecond edge., In India, there are a handful of billionaires, and 400 million people without electricity.On today\'s Planet Money, we ask the question: With India\'s economy growing at 8 percent per year, why are so many people there still so poor?We hear from economists, and from Umrao Singh, a 75-year-old cobbler who lives on the street in Delhi., This is the first episode in a new series we\'re trying out. The Planet Money Deep Read will feature in-depth conversations with big thinkers.  Today on the Planet Money Deep Read, we talk with Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, about his new book: The End of the Free Market., Back in the \'80s, Kay Fishburn had a dream: Americans would band together and make voluntary donations to the government to bring the national debt way down. She became something of a minor celebrity.On today\'s Planet Money, we check in with Fishburn. And we talk to an economist, who explains why it would be a bad idea for Americans to raid their savings accounts to pay off the national debt.It\'s all part of our ongoing quest to understand this whole gifts-to-pay-down-the-debt thing., On today\'s podcast, we take a field trip to Barney\'s. (Do you have any idea what they charge for a t-shirt there?) Our guide is Claire Hamilton, a trend analyst at a company called WGSN.And we talk to Ed Jay, a senior VP at American Express. He gathered data about 100,000 people who used their AmEx card to donate to public radio, and told us what other kind of stuff they bought., "When this bill becomes law, the joyride on Wall Street will come to a screeching halt," Harry Reid said last week, after the Senate passed its big finance reform bill.Today on Planet Money, we dig into the "Volcker Rule" -- the bill\'s ostensible ban on banks trading with their own money. And we look at the question:Will the joyride really come to a screeching halt? And would it be a good thing if it did?, We bought her for $1,000 early this year. The mortgages she\'s made of were going sour at an alarming rate. When enough of the mortgages went bad, she would die.On today\'s Planet Money: Toxie -- Planet Money\'s mortgage-backed toxic asset -- is in a coma., During the credit boom, lots of payday loan stores sprang up in Mansfield, Ohio.You\'d expect that all those companies would have competed with each other, driving down interest interest rates for borrowers, But that didn\'t happen; they all charged, basically, the same price.The lack of competition may have been the unintended consequence of a law that was supposed to protect borrowers., There\'s this weird thing in the movie business: Almost all movies lose money. Except they don\'t, really.On today\'s Planet Money, Edward Jay Epstein, the author of a recent book called The Hollywood Economist, explains the business of movies.As a case study, he walks us through the numbers for "Gone In 60 Seconds." (It starred Angelina Jolie and Nicolas Cage. They stole cars. Don\'t pretend like you don\'t remember it.), In Athens, everybody has a story about how easy it was to borrow money after Greece joined the euro and interest rates plummeted. On today\'s Planet Money, Chana Joffe-Walt brings back a few of those tales.Her cab driver upgraded from a Toyota to a Mercedes. Paul Emmanuelides, who owned a couple bars, borrowed 7 million euros to build an industrial brewery. People borrowed money to go on vacation -- then refinanced the loans. "It was like manna from heaven," one lady says.Where did all the money come from?A lot of it came from Newport Beach, home of the giant bond fund Pimco. Adam Davidson was there last week, and he spoke with Mohamed El-Erian, Pimco\'s CEO., First, an NYU finance professor talks about yesterday\'s wild market swings. Turns out, a sort of "circuit breaker" that\'s supposed to settle the market may have backfired.Then, we go behind the scenes at Standard &amp; Poor\'s to answer a question that\'s been on our mind lately: How do you rate a country?Also answered in the podcast: Do agencies think twice before lowering a country\'s rating to junk?, So Maria Bartiromo let her trademarks lapse on "Money Honey." Sensing a huge opportunity to make a killing in the visor business, we swooped in and applied for our own Money Honey trademark.You can read the application here, on the Web site of the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. It\'s good for caps and visors, as well as "headbands against sweating."We were super excited, until we talked to a few intellectual property lawyers. They told us that a trademark isn\'t enough.There\'s this whole other thing called a "right of privacy.", In Jamaica, people don\'t fear the tax collector. On today\'s Planet Money, we hear from Kimala Bennett, an entrepreneur who decided that should change. Her goal is to get all the Jamaican entrepreneurs who think of themselves as hustlers to straighten up and turn into proper business people. Her inspiration, naturally, is CNBC\'s Donny Deutsch., David Kestenbaum tries to figure out why there\'s so much bureaucracy in India. He comes up with a few possible answers \xe2\x80\x94 legacy of colonialism, pretext for bribery, machinery of democracy. He also brings back a few pictures of red tape in action., Gagan Singh was 22 years old when he started a small business in Delhi, India, delivering telephone and Internet service. To get the business going, he needed to string up some wires and get licenses from the government. To make that happen, he had to start bribing people.Singh had to bribe, basically, everybody: the lineman, the junior engineer, the senior engineer, their bosses. He hated it it. He didn\'t even want to be a businessman; he wanted to be an artist., We dive into the SEC\'s lawsuit against Goldman Sachs, and Goldman\'s emphatic arguments in its defense. We consider the similarities between this case and that Magnetar story that aired recently on This American Life.And our long quest to unite financial reporting with Broadway theater continues. (Spoiler: It\'s a dramatic reading of a Goldman executive\'s convoluted answer to a key question about the case.)For more, listen to a recording of the conference call Goldman hosted this morning, and read our posts explaining the SEC\'s case and hashing out one piece of Goldman\'s defense. You can also read the SEC\'s complaint and Goldman\'s response., A toxic asset \xe2\x80\x94 very much like our own Toxie \xe2\x80\x94 goes bad. And a New Jersey carpenters\' union fund that bought a piece of the asset tries to figure out if there\'s someone to blame.On today\'s Planet Money, we hear from a carpenter, a lawyer and a guy who owns a pub in London. Oddly enough, the pub owner could be the one bailing the carpenters out., The lead singer of the band OK Go, famous for the video where they dance on treadmills, talks about the economics of Rock and his band\'s decision to leave their label and start their own record company., We landed a rare broadcast interview with William Dudley, the president of the New York Fed.The classic Fed stance has been that there\'s not much that regulators can do about the economic bubbles that grow and pop. Dudley disagrees \xe2\x80\x94 at least, he says, fighting bubbles is worth a shot., The Federal Reserve owns the biggest mall in Oklahoma, and it\'s looking to sell.The mall is one of the many, many assets the Fed bought to bail out Bear Stearns a few years back. The assets were bundled into a special company called Maiden Lane I.Also on the bank\'s shopping list: A bundle of home mortgages that\'s closely related to Toxie, Planet Money\'s toxic asset. (Does that make us, like, in-laws with the Fed?)For the most part, the Fed owns financial stuff like loans and swaps. The assets it bought as part of the Bear bailout included a mortgage on the Crossroads Mall in Oklahoma City. When the owners of the mall defaulted on the mortgage, the Fed foreclosed.So if you\'re looking to buy yourself a mall in Oklahoma, you might check out Crossroads. As the listing notes, "this lender owned distressed asset ... can be purchased at far below replacement cost." It includes an AMC theater as well as a "former JC Penney (vacant)," and a "former Steve &amp; Barry\'s (vacant).", So there was a big shipping bubble that inflated about the same time the housing bubble did. It grew for some similar reasons \xe2\x80\x94 a go-go economy, easy credit, a belief that prices never decline, etc. And, like housing, it\'s now turned ugly.Ships that cost more than $100 million a few years back now go for $40 million \xe2\x80\x94 and the rates for freight have fallen accordingly. Ship owners have gone bust, and their ships have been taken by the bank and sold at auction., That\'s Lynn Tilton up there. She runs a $7 billion private equity firm called Patriarch Partners that specializes in scooping up companies teetering on the brink of bankruptcy.On today\'s podcast, we visit with Tilton. And we go inside Spiegel, the catalog company Patriarch bought last year., The FDIC swoops in and closes a failing bank. Then what?Last year, Chana Joffe-Walt told the story of a bank failure. In today\'s podcast, she follow up with the main players.The FDIC guy who closed the bank down gets choked up when he thinks back on it. And Todd Zalk \xe2\x80\x94 who was so connected to his job that he wore his bank name tag months after the bank closed \xe2\x80\x94 describes how it felt when a former colleague pleaded guilty to hiding bad loans., President Obama signed the health-care bill today. You know this. So what does it mean?Millions of uninsured people will get health insurance. Millions of people with high incomes will pay higher taxes. Medicare spending will grow a little less. But the broader issue of rising health costs will remain a problem.Today\'s podcast explains all that, with the help of uninsured manfriend and some very bad jokes., s China manipulating its currency? What does it even mean to manipulate a currency, anyway, and how does a country do it?On today\'s Planet Money, Alex Blumberg and David Kestenbaum explain with help from economics professor Paul Wachtel and entrepreneur Imran Karim., Adam Davidson and Chana Joffe-Walt, who\'ve been reporting in Haiti, talk to Prime Minister Jean Max Bellerive. He runs the government\'s day-to-day affairs; President Rene Preval is the head of state.They interview Bellerive at his official residence, and while they\'re talking, a U.S. Army helicopter flies by. It\'s a reminder of the massive foreign presence in Haiti. And it\'s not just the military; all sorts of people from around the world looking at everything from Haiti\'s ports to its health-care system.But as plans for what Bellerive calls Haiti\'s "refoundation" get hashed out, there\'s some tension between the Haitian government and the international community., In today\'s podcast, Alex and David talk with Reps. John Campbell and Brad Miller about what went into the House finance bill. They also talk about derivatives and resolution authority with Mike Konczal, the finance guy behind the blog Rortybomb., We wanted to really understand how this whole housing bust/economic catastrophe is playing out. So we sent David Kestenbaum and Chana Joffe-Walt to Kansas City, where a former Wall Street guy named Wit Solberg runs a shop that buys and sells toxic assets.Wit sold them a $1,000 sliver of a toxic asset he\'d bought for $36,000. The asset \xe2\x80\x94 a bond made up of residential mortgages \xe2\x80\x94 was marked down from the pre-crash price of $2.7 million.Of course, it\'s marked down for a reason. About 15 percent of the homes in the bond are in foreclosure, and nearly half are behind on their payments. The foreclosures will continue to mount, and at a certain point our asset will be wiped out. But until then, we\'ll get monthly payments. If we make it to Thanksgiving, we could double our money. (We\'ll be giving any profits to charity, by the way.), Could the Greek crisis spell the end of the Euro? No way, says Berkeley economist Barry Eichengreen. Eichengreen, says that if the Greek parliament were to even discuss the possibility of going back to Greece\'s old currency, the Drachma, it would send people running from Greek bonds. Eichengreen\'s got plenty more to say about the Euro. He argued recently that European countries should put in place a system for Euro-zone bailouts, complete with "temporary control of the national budget by a committee of \'special masters\' appointed by the European Union." (Somehow, this idea seems unlikely to gain much traction with European governments.), The economies of Jamaica and Barbados \xe2\x80\x94 two countries with very similar histories \xe2\x80\x94 have grown far apart in the last several decades. That difference in GDP shows up in all sorts of ways, Planet Money\'s Alex Blumberg found on a recent trip to both countries. Today, we get the first installment: What schools look like in each country. A principal in Jamaica keeps her school running with help from neighborhood volunteers, a donation from a Jamaican pop star and some funding from a U.S. aid program. A principal at a similar school in Barbados says government funding does a pretty good job of meeting the school\'s needs, Adam Davidson takes a road trip to Vegas, via Haiti.When Adam and Chana Joffe-Walt traveled to Haiti recently, they kept hearing about "Magic" \xe2\x80\x94 a big clothing trade show in Vegas that the Haitians hoped would be a post-earthquake boon for their apparel industry.So Adam went to Vegas for the show. But Haiti, as it turns out, is only a bit player on the Vegas scene, swamped by the likes of China, Bangladesh and Egypt. And the real star of the show turns out to be Ron Kirk, the U.S. trade representative. What Haiti (and everybody else) really wants is a sweet trade deal with the U.S., Greece is scrambling to get its national debt under control. Investors are already nervous. So what would happen if Greece actually defaulted-- if it simply stopped making payments on its bonds?   Investors would go beyond nervous. They might even panic. Particularly because Greece isn\'t alone among European countries when it comes to being heavily indebted. Investors would start demanding higher interest rates on bonds sold by countries like Spain, Italy and Portugal. And then they, in turn, could default.At least, that\'s what Ken Rogoff, Harvard prof and former chief economist at the IMF, says in today\'s podcast.His description reminded us of what happened after Lehman Brothers went bankrupt; panic ensued, and a bunch of other big companies fell apart. So if push comes to shove, will Greece be like Bear Stearns \xe2\x80\x94 saved from default at the last minute \xe2\x80\x94 or like Lehman Brothers?, Last week on This American Life, our own Alex Blumberg had a story about corporate personhood.  The idea was actually pitched by Alex\'s dad, who was pretty upset about the recent Supreme Court ruling that essentially said: "Hey, giant companies are like people. So they get to spend money on political campaigns just like you and me."It was Alex\'s father\'s dream that motivated him to the bottom of this issue. He wanted Alex to call up Exxon Mobil and say: "Who do you think you are?"  Alex\'s story went on the radio-- but halfway through the crew over at TAL cut it off.  They thought it was too boring.  We here at PM felt otherwise.  Apparently you did too.  We got lots of emails and tweets from listeners asking for the rest of the story.  So today, we bring you Alex\'s full story on corporations as people.  We also check back in with his dad., We meet Yvrose Jean Baptiste, a small-time Haitian wholesaler. Yvrose has a unique business model. She borrows money from a microcredit bank and every two weeks takes a bus to the Dominican Republic border, where she buys a bunch of produce and products to bring back to Port-au-Prince. She then lends out her goods out to various small shop owners and people who sell things on the street. She gives them two weeks to sell everything and then comes back to pick up the money.Yrose says it\'s been a successful model in the past, but the earthquake has been a big hit to her business. Most of her inventory has been destroyed and now she has to scramble to pay the loan back., We meet "Mango Man," Jean Maurice Buteau who heads JMB exports in Port-au-Prince.  Jean Maurice buys mangoes from rural Haitian farmers and sells them to the US.  Unfortunately, between the mango farm and his office near the port, almost half the mangoes get damaged.  If Jean Maurice could just get his farmers to put their mangoes in plastic crates, he says he could double his revenue and the farmers\' income. We take a look at why a simple idea like plastic crates, is in Haiti, not so simple at all., We look at the world through the eyes of Matt LeBlanc, an efficiency expert (or lean expert), who runs around with a stopwatch and equations, trying to figure out how to eliminate waste in our economy.  He finds it everywhere.LeBlanc says sometimes people love him and thank him.  And sometimes not., Adam and Chana are on the ground in Haiti.  And despite the general misery and constant funerals, Adam tells us people there are starting to talk about how to rebuild the country and the economy, maybe in a better way.  The world helped rebuild Indonesia after the tsunami, and Rwanda after the genocide.  But Haiti\'s troubles run deep, and have existed for decades., Economist editor,Tom Standage, says if you want to get a good picture of world history, you should look at spices. In his book, An Edible History of Humanity, Standage writes about how tall tales of carnivorous birds and flying snakes let Arab middleman charge Europeans inflated prices for cinnamon and pepper for years. Standage says it wasn\'t until an Indian ship went adrift in the Red Sea that the Europeans realized there was an easier route to get all those spices they had been craving., We hear from Mary Kinsley, a lawyer in Phoenix who works at a legal help-line for people with real estate questions. She says her unit gets around 100 calls a day, almost all from people asking about foreclosure.Mary says that starting last year, the questions changed dramatically. In 2007 and 2008, callers couldn\'t pay their mortgages but wanted to Mary to help them find a way to keep their houses. Now most callers aren\'t trying to avoid foreclosure, instead they want Mary to help them bring it on as fast as possible. It\'s called strategic default, where the borrower owes so much more than the house is worth, that it makes more sense to just give the keys back to the bank., Fourteen states have adopted medical marijuana laws. We talk to Harvard economist Jeffrey Miron about what happens when drugs move from the black market to the open market. Do they get 100 times cheaper? Or maybe, instead more expensive? Miron talks about the economics of prohibition, and reveals his drug of choice (which is legal) and one he would like to try (which is not)., We bring you a story about a cable television producer from New Jersey, a podcasting libertarian economist, an international pop superstar and the two dead economists who brought them all together. Plus, some really great music., On today\'s Planet Money:We take a closer look at proprietary trading, which is under attack by the latest proposal from the Obama administration. The new banking regulations proposed by the president call for a ban on commercial banks engaging in potentially risky trades with their own funds-- or, in some cases, your funds. So we called up MIT Sloan School of Management professor Andrew Lo to shed some light on the murky world of \'prop trading\', as the cool kids like to call it., We debate the merits of the so-called "Cadillac" tax, a proposed tax tax on expensive health insurance plans.  Jonathan Gruber, an economist at MIT, is a champion of the tax. He says charging consumers a bit more for pricey plans will make them think twice about rushing off to the emergency room for a swollen knee. Plus, he says it could mean a few extra dollars in your pocket. Gruber reasons that if employers are spending less on benefits, they\'ll put more money into paychecks.  Not everyone agrees with Gruber including today\'s special guest. He says the tax will only make employers richer and hurt the middle class., On today\'s podcast the exciting conclusion of our two-part examination of Denmark\'s unusual economy, part free-market, part huge welfare state.   Denmark\'s government truly takes care of its people when it comes to things like health care and education.  All that cost money though.  A recent headline in a Copenhagen newspaper read "Denmark wins highest tax competition."  Yes, in 2009 the country had the highest taxes in the world, the most dramatic example being car purchases, which are taxed at 200 percent., We take you to Denmark, land of bicycles, pigs, Ikea-like furniture and economic indicators that seem too good to be true. Denmark has one of the lowest poverty rates in the world and lowest income disparities. At one point the jobs picture was so good unemployment dropped below 2 percent, something some economists would tell you should be impossible. Despite having the highest taxes in the world, Denmark\'s economy has grown steadily. Plus, Danes are the happiest people in the world, at least according to one analysis., We go inside the "dirty unspoken world" of bill collectors with listener John Goebel. Goebel\'s been in the collection industry for a few years now. He started collecting second mortgages and car loans in college and now works part-time trying to recover subprime credit card debt.He says the hardest part of his job is navigating the landmines of emotion that come with each call. He\'s been hung up on, sworn at, yelled at by children and about once a week he has to listen to someone just completely break down., As great figures from history go, John Maynard Keynes should consider himself lucky, at least when it comes to his biography. His biographer, Lord Robert Skidelsky, is one of the best. His three-volume biography of Keynes is not only comprehensive (1000+ pages) \xe2\x80\x94 it\'s also funny, insightful and, frankly, a little raunchy.Skidelsky has a new book about Keynes out, called Keynes: The Return of the Master. We talk with him about how Keynes developed the ideas that (at least according to some people) got us out of the Great Depression., We hear and read stories of corruption every day, but finding cold hard data on the subject is so hard that MIT economics professor, Ben Olken, had to go dig up roads in Indonesia to get some. Olken and his team set out to measure the amount of raw materials that went missing when the government gave local villages money for projects like building roads. The study required the researchers to not only dig up roads \xe2\x80\x94  but also to build a few of their own., How does the U.S. rank in terms of corruption compared to other countries? Transparency International puts us 15th on its Corruption Perceptions Index, which "measures the perceived level of public-sector corruption in 180 countries and territories around the world."Jermyn Brooks, chair of the group\'s business advisory board, tells us how we landed there and what we can do to climb up., We continue our conversation about how economics and technology have shaped the news business.NPR media correspondent, David Folkenflik, stops by to tell us Microsoft and News Corp. owner, Rupert Murdoch, are in talks to give Microsoft\'s new search engine, Bing, exclusive access to Wall Street Journal content. The deal could bring Murdoch\'s media company millions of dollars and give the Bing a real chance compete with Google., We may think of our independent press today as being the result of political awakening and noble efforts by those seeking truth, but that\'s not the whole story. University of Chicago economist, Matthew Gentzkow, says we\'ve progressed not just because of good intentions, but because of basic economics. Gentzkow explains how advances in printing helped newspapers expand their audience beyond just one political party., We announce the winner of our economic abstract translation contest and find out what the paper\'s author really meant by "hybrid translog cost functions." Plus, we reach out to Aaron Edlin, one of the editors of the Economists\' Voice, to get his take on how much jargon we really need., Another very special radio competition. We sent Adam Davidson, Chana Joffe-Walt and Alex Blumberg to the International Council of Shopping Centers\' New York Conference and challenged them to bring back the best economics stories they could find. Listen to their stories, hear our panel of celebrity judges weigh in and then decide who you think should be the winner., On today\'s Planet Money:Adam Davidson chats with the intrepid David Kestenbaum about both the theatrics and real policy debates going on at the current climate conference in Copenhagen. First, meet a biker who powers up music with his feet for outdoor dance sessions and, with the late Friday announcement that a global agreement of some sort has been reached at the conference, listen to the potential promises and pitfalls of a key aspect of the deal \xe2\x80\x94 a "cap and trade" carbon reduction plan., On today\'s Planet Money:In an ongoing investigation by ProPublica, a non-profit investigative newsroom, in collaboration with NPR\'s Planet Money, reporters found that almost three years since banks starting taking losses that led to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, the Securities and Exchange Commission is still asking basic questions about what happened. Planet Money\'s Adam Davidson and Chana Joffe-Walt and Propublica\'s Jake Bernstein and Jesse Eisinger talk about the story, published Wednesday on NPR.org., On today\'s Planet Money:Adam Davidson and Alex Blumberg chat with Amartya Sen, a Nobel Prize Laureate in Economics, about his new book, The Idea of Justice, and its critique of the theory of social justice. Sen spends time in his book, and on the podcast, talking about what he sees as common misinterpretations of Adam Smith\'s oft-cited but perhaps more complex embrace of an absolute free market., The Planet Money team hits the streets of New York to check out why stores clump together., Our own David Kestenbaum is currently on route to Copenhagen where he will be spending several days reporting at the Climate Conference. David gives us an early windup of what he expects to be looking out for, including details on how much money countries plan on putting up to modernize energy economies across the globe. Plus, one very passionate delegate from the Solomon Islands., Russ Roberts, George Mason University economist and host of EconTalk, explains why he thinks is economics is an imperfect science.Roberts says he has come to believe it\'s impossible to predict future economic conditions because good data is so hard to come by and even harder to compare. So what about all his fellow economists who seem to have an opinion on almost any topic? Roberts says they should come out and tell the truth, that their policy recommendations are based on philosophy and ideology, not on empirical data., An American journalist in Japan, Jake Adelstein, has spent a decade covering the world of organized crime. He talks about how the business of the yakuza groups has changed over time and how tighter government restrictions have pushed the Japanese mob into more "traditional" investments., The announcement earlier this week, that Dubai World, a company owned by the government of Dubai, was hoping to delay payment on $26 billion in debt sent stock markets across the world plummeting. Analysts were watching to see if investors would pull out of banks and investment firms with exposure in the Middle East or flee risky markets altogether.By now, fears of Dubai\'s credit crisis spreading outside the country appear to have abated, but questions about Dubai remain, like, "what in the world were they thinking?" Dr. Christian Koch of the Gulf Research Center, says Dubai has a good economic strategy, but things got too crazy, too quickly. To Jane Meikle, a Canadian who has spent the last four years living in Dubai, sure the place went a little crazy, but that\'s part of what makes it so great. She talks about the upside of life in a gulf state boom town, where everyone is from somewhere else., Economists see climate change as a tragedy of the commons problem. We benefit by putting carbon into the atmosphere because it means cheap electricity and cheap gasoline. In the short term, we save money but eventually if we continue, we\'ll all suffer.Nobel prize winner Elinor Ostrom says the answer to fixing rising temperatures has to come from the people not the government. But reducing our carbon emissions is expensive and some economists wonder if we\'re willing to pay for it. To answer that question, German zoologist, Manfred Milinski come up with a game that tests how much we would be willing to pay now to save the Earth later. Joined by a special group of NPR staff, the Planet Money team plays his game and get a surprising result., Economist Joel Waldfogel says giving gifts people don\'t want isn\'t just bad for the recipients, it\'s bad for the economy. According to his research, billions of dollars are wasted each year because of holiday shopping. A professor at Wharton, he has spent years surveying his students about how much items they received as gifts cost and how much they would pay for the same items. Based on those surveys, Waldfogel says the spending others do for us produces about 20 percent less satisfaction than the spending we do for ourselves.Despite the title of his book, Scroogenomics: Why You Shouldn\'t Buy Presents For The Holidays, Waldfogel says he doesn\'t want to end giving gift, in fact he enjoys it. He says he just wants us to think harder about who we are buying for and maybe choose a gift card over that reindeer sweater., Nuhu Ribadu spent years fighting corruption in Nigeria. From his early days in the Nigerian police force to his later years as Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ribadu battled the corruption that strangled his country\'s economic growth. He had some success for a while, but after two attempts on his life, he was forced to leave his home country and come to the United States. He shares the stories of his struggle and says he hasn\'t given up yet., We continue our search for answers about why MRI prices can differ so greatly. This time we travel from New Haven, Conn. to Japan, where an MRI costs only $160. Why? Well, it\'s because of the government, the quality of the machines and as we\'ll hear from neurologist Dr. Michiko Kimura Bruno, because Japanese people really love MRIs., NPR business correspondent Frank Langfitt headed to China a few weeks ago expecting to find a triumphant people. The Chinese economy has recovered much more quickly than many parts of the world and Langfitt says he thought people would be gloating. But that just wasn\'t the case, instead Langfitt found himself being comforted by the Chinese about the strength of the United States.Many people he spoke to said their country still has a long way to go before overtaking the U.S. economy. Part of the reason, factory workers in the southern part of the country have seen layoffs that Langfitt says, just can\'t be compared to Detroit. Returning to factories he had visited years ago, Langfitt found doors locked and furniture strewn about outside. Why\'s that? It\'s simple \xe2\x80\x94 Americans have stopped buying., Last week two Bear Stearns hedge fund managers were acquitted on charges of fraud, stemming from the collapse of two funds they managed in 2007. The government alleged the men knowingly misled investors about the health of the funds by lying about how much money they had personally invested in them and how many redemptions they had. The defense argued that comments made by the men in personal emails were just strategy talk. WNYC reporter Lisa Chow covered the case, she joins us to talk about the verdict and what it may mean for future trials., Jeremy Anwyl, the chief executive of Edmunds.com, defends his company\'s latest report about the effectiveness of the much-hyped and recently closed Cash for Clunkers program. Edmunds found the program added only 125,000 in sales at a cost of $3.5 billion, or $24,000 per new car. But Austin Goolsbee, a University of Chicago economist currently serving as a member of the Council of Economic Advisers, doesn\'t think those numbers are right. His analysis puts the number of Cash for Clunkers sales closer to 450,000., Economist and Planet Money regular Simon Johnson thinks it\'s time to break up the big banks. Simon says the current regulations aren\'t enough to prevent another crisis and we need to do something more drastic. Former head of the Federal Reserve, Paul Volcker and Mervyn King, head of the British central bank, agree, but that hasn\'t convinced Martin Baily of the Brookings Institution. Baily, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Clinton administration, is worried about the unintended consequences of bad regulation. He says the risk simply isn\'t worth it., When people talk about the current economic crisis they bring up theGreat Depression and Japan\'s lost decade, but the world\'s history of\'financial folly\' spans much larger, through eight centuries and 66different countries. In their new book, This Time Is Different,economist Ken Rogoff of Harvard, and Carmen Reinhart of University ofMaryland, tell the stories of financial crises from medieval currencydebasements to the recent subprime mess. Reinhart says our currenttroubles are nothing new, and what\'s worse, she predicts we\'re doomed torepeat the mistakes of our predecessors., How can one hospital charge $800 for an MRI while the stand alone clinic down the street charges $450? We visit two MRI centers in Pensacola, Florida to find out., When the government created the Medicare system in 1965, they were so desperate to get doctors into it that they allowed them set their own fees. The fee for service system was good for doctors, who now got paid for giving health care to the poor and elderly, but bad for the government. The crushing weight of doctors fees soon sent government budgets out of control. Ten years later, President Ford thought he had the solution, cap the fees paid to doctors. Unfortunately capping fees just caused another problem, overtreatment. It wasn\'t until the late 1980\'s that an economist from Harvard, Professor William Hsiao, finally came up with method to determine competitive prices for doctor\'s care \xe2\x80\x94 the relative value scale. Though this scale is used today, the problem of over paying doctors still exists. Hsiao, says that\'s because special interests have gotten a hold of his scale distorted it., The world\'s governments have given a trillion dollars in aid developing nations since WWII, and yet in some countries, particularly in Africa, the economic situation is just as bad or worse than it\'s ever been.Columbia economist and former economic adviser to the Bush administration, Glenn Hubbard, says it\'s time to change the way we give aid to Africa. Hubbard, co-author of The Aid Trap: Hard Truths About Ending Poverty, advocates a modern day Marshall plan, which would give money directly to local businesses instead of government., Economics teacher Heather Hanemann has developed a curriculum based on several of the Planet Money podcasts. We visited her classroom here in Manhattan to see what the kids thought about the show and hear how the financial crisis has played out in their lives., GMAC is on the way to achieving the special distinction of three federal bailouts. The financial institution has already received $12.5 billion in assistance, for which the government has taken a stake of nearly 35 percent in the company.Columbia economist Charles Calomiris says the GMAC case is a textbook example of the dangers that come with taxpayer bailouts. Calomiris says the government ends up giving money to keep a foundering bank afloat. The bank takes what\'s known as "resurrection risk," the economic equivalent of football\'s Hail Mary pass. There\'s more. Senior Vice President Paul Merski of the Independent Community Bankers of America says that with government backing in place, GMAC is getting an unfair competitive advantage., Since the start of the financial crisis, the U.S. government has put $50 billion into General Motors. After GM emerged from bankruptcy this year, the public owned 61 percent of the stock of the newly reconstituted company. How much of that $50 billion will the American taxpayer get back? CEO Fritz Henderson says business at GM is getting better, which is at least a hopeful sign for repayment. But the situation at GM is so complicated, Henderson says, that he can\'t say yet how much money GM will be able to return to the public coffers.Longtime auto analyst John Casesa has crunched the numbers we have. He says GM would have to do everything right, in a strong economy, to pay back what it owes.Meanwhile, a Congressional Oversight Panel report says the public will get back less than half the money it used to bail out GM and Chrysler., This month, Indiana University professor Elinor Ostrom became thefirst woman to win the Nobel prize for economics.Ostrom explains her groundbreaking research into the public management of naturalresources. The political scientist argues that people should be empowered toorganize themselves in small ways that scale up to a global network. Government canbe helpful in doing that, but people shouldn\'t rely on it alone., Human beings aren\'t the only creatures who make economic decisions. It turns out that monkeys do it, too. Scientists have observed our primate kin exchanging goods and services and adjusting prices.Ronald Noe, a professor of primate ethnology at the University of Strasbourg, says the vervet monkey of southern and eastern Africa uses grooming as a kind of currency. Vervets determine the value of food providers and divide their attention according to the law of supply and demand., Gregory Schiedler works for a foreign oil company in Angola\'s capital Luanda. He lives in a gated community, gets driven to work everyday and is responsible for spending one billion dollars in the next year. Gregory has very little interaction with Angolans except for one, the teenager who sells him chewing gum.Minguito works on the streets of Angola selling cigarettes, shoe shines and gum to foreigners like Gregory and anyone else who wants to buy them. He\'s tired of working on the street and running from the police, but he says he feels like he has no choice.Retired U.S. diplomat Herman Cohen explains why billions of dollars of oil money flowing into Angola have done little to help the people who live there., On today\'s Planet Money: We give a sneak preview of our upcoming This American Life special on health insurance.How much would you pay to protect someone or something you love? Kristin Zorbini Bongard and her husband love their pet hedgehog, Harriet, so much that they spend about $80 a year on health insurance for her. Even with the coverage, they shelled out $1,911.20 for the hedgehog\'s cancer treatment.Economist Tim Harford, the Financial Times\' Undercover Economist, who admits to not being a pet person, says the problem with pet insurance is not that it\'s for pets. It\'s that it causes waste, because you\'re spending someone else\'s money., On today\'s Planet Money:You\'ve got economic riddles, and economists have answers.First up, Emily Oster of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business tackles the question about minimum wage. Why is that cities that have raised their minimum wages so often have lower rates of joblessness and healthier economies?Second, Robert Frank of Cornell wrestles with the question of why software companies set such widely varying prices for essentially the same software., On today\'s Planet Money: Ian Bremmer of Eurasia Group and professor Kishore Mahbubani of the National University of Singapore take us on a brief world tour.Mahbubani, author of the New Asian Hemisphere, argues that the most of the world is preparing for China\'s coming global dominance. It\'s a psychological adjustment that Americans aren\'t yet ready to make.Bremmer, author of The Fat Tail, says that if the Chinese economy remains state-controlled, American businesses won\'t get a level playing field. But Americans shouldn\'t necessarily fear the rise of China, because the U.S. and China will continue to need each other for many years to come., Human beings have always loved their children, but at certain times in history they really needed them, for economic reasons.Mick Watson, chair of the psychology department at Brandeis University, explains how economics have impacted parenting styles from our early days as hunter-gatherers to today\'s modern industrial society., You\'ve seen those crazy-looking medical bills, the ones with row after row of prices and treatment codes. How about one that says the service cost $1,200, except your insurer paid $400 and you the patient owe nothing? Where did that other money go?Doctor bills are complicated enough to make you go looking for a Harvard health care economist. Which is just what we did. Today, professor Joseph Newhouse fields your questions., During the Great Depression, people began ditching capitalism for alternative ideologies like communism or socialism. That hasn\'t happened during the Great Recession, despite people saying that capitalism\'s flaws are on full display. Socialist parties have been losing ground across Europe. In Germany, for example, the Socialist Democratic Party just made its poorest showing in elections since World War II. Eurasia Group\'s David Gordon says the political right is doing well in Europe these days because it has co-opted issues that traditionally belonged to the left. Where the left remains popular, as it does in Latin America, successful politicians have moved to the right. Meanwhile, he argues, the left lacks a compelling narrative about what caused the economic crisis., The U.S. Senate Finance Committee twice voted down a measure to have the government offer a health insurance plan \xe2\x80\x94 the so-called public option. In countries like England and Canada, the public option is a fact of life. Taxpayers put money into the system and everyone automatically gets health insurance from the government, in what\'s known as a single-payer system.Should the government run our health insurance? Donna Smith of the California Nurses Association says it should. Smith, whose personal insurance nightmare figures in the Michael Moore documentary Sicko, says a single-payer system would get care to more people and save money.  Stuart Butler of the Heritage Foundation says government shouldn\'t become everyone\'s insurance company. Butler, who\'s from the U.K., says single-payer care is no cure-all., Health care cooperatives are insurance companies owned by ordinary patients who buy in. The Senate Finance Committee is working on a $6 billion measure, pushed by Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.), that would set up health care cooperatives across the nation. The idea is to have cooperatives take the place of the public option, in which the government would set up an insurance plan to compete with ones from private companies.A health coop that saves you money may be something of a unicorn, says reporter Keith Seinfeld of Seattle\'s KPLU. Seinfeld belongs to a health care cooperative already, one of only two in the country. He says he doesn\'t see his own Group Health Cooperative as being better than other providers at controlling costs. What\'s more, the input from its 600,000 members may not amount to much when only 3,000 of them choose to vote.With an expert opinion from Tim Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee, who says health coops are expensive to start and run. Their main benefit: They make people happier., On today\'s Planet Money: Rich nations and developing ones in the G20 got together in Pittsburgh this week to discuss the fate of the world. Also, how to fix it.Among the key issues was how to give emerging markets a meaningful seat at the table. For starters, the G20 will now replace the G8, which includes only leading nations. David Gordon, head of research at Eurasia Group, says that\'s a start, a small one. Meanwhile, NPR\'s Scott Horsley ventured out past the protesters in search of an alternative G20 scene., We revisit the show that fathered our podcast \xe2\x80\x94 The Giant Pool of Money.In that show, Adam and Alex set out to explain a simple question: "Why would the financial services industry rush to make lots of loans to people who couldn\'t pay them back?" They traced the mortgage chain from the people who took out the loans to those who re-packaged them and sold them off. That show aired in May of 2008 several months before we knew the extent giant financial collapse we were headed for. Today we visit two of the people featured in that piece. Richard, a Marine who was facing foreclosure, and Jim Finkel, a CDO manager, to see they\'ve fared in the downturn., Meet Jacob Hacker, the father of the "public option." Hacker, a Yale political science professor, introduced the notion of the federal government offering a health insurance plan that would compete with ones from private companies.President Obama calls the public option a means of pressuring private insurers to keep policies affordable, while critics say it would put them at an unfair disadvantage.Now Hacker takes a turn defending his big idea, saying that a public plan would cost less to run and be able to bargain for better prices., Right now someone out there is writing a new line in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule, a 35 percent tariff on Chinese tires. President Obama announced the new tariff last week, angering the Chinese, who quickly responded with promises to investigate tariffs on the US poultry and automotive industries.The tariff tussle has sparked fears of a trade war between the US and China. Arvind Subramanian, economist at the Peterson Institute, says the new tariff may add to messy trade relations, but it will have little impact on the marketplace. That\'s good news for poultry producer Eric Joiner, who says he depends on China for sales of his chicken paws., Much of this economic crisis has been caused by strange financial products that fell between the cracks of regulatory agencies. As we now know, more regulators didn\'t always make things better, they often made things worse.Adam Davidson and Alex Blumberg tell the story of the SEC and the CFTC, two agencies that have fought hard to stay apart while the products they regulate grow more and more intertwined. Both Republicans and Democrats agree the two should become one, but former House Financial Services Committee chairman Mike Oxley says the chances of that happening are about as good as him beating Tiger Woods., Highlights from our live debate on financial regulatory reform, hosted by Planet Money and the Pew Charitable Trusts- Bob Litan and Scott Talbott duke it out over what to do with financial institutions that are too big to fail. - Adam Levitin and Diane Casey-Landry sound off on a proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency. - Darrell Duffie and Mark Brickell dispute the future of derivatives. With special appearances by Alice Rivlin, Martin Bailey, Charles Calomiris, Peter Wallison and Adam\'s dad, Jack Davidson., Co-payments for prescription drugs are one of the ways health insurance companies try to contain costs. Co-pays for generic drugs are often cheaper than for brand name option, so consumers opt for the drug that\'s cheaper for the insurance agency. But some drug companies have come up with a way to undermine the system. They\'re handing out "co-pay assistance cards," which are basically like coupons for prescription drugs. They offer you a discount on the co-pay of a particular brand name drug, making the brand name effectively cheaper than the generic.It may sound like a great deal for consumers, but the Wall Street Journal\'s John Rockoff, says the coupons come with some hidden costs., On today\'s Planet Money, Adam Davidson and Alex Blumberg spent the summer of 2008 working on the story that would launch Planet Money \xe2\x80\x94 a Chana Joffe-Walt report about the connection between Chinese windmills and U.S. airplanes.But a funny thing happened on the way to that first feature: in a terrifying series of financial calamities last summer, the global economy darned near died. What began as the month we all started thinking about Too Big Too Fail turned into Planet Money\'s first crazy, crazy year. You were there. Celebrate it with us in this anniversary podcast., We\'ve been talking lately with medieval historian Philip Daileader about how very little fun it was to live in 12th century France.Now, thanks to a nudge from listener Alan Munter, we\'re looking at the state of economic life in Asia. Historian Kenneth Pomeranz says pre-industrial China was no picnic, either. Life expectancy in the lower Yangtze River Valley was probably about 35 in the year zero, Pomeranz says, and it was probably about the same in 1800. At least from the 1,000 on, people began spending more time at work, but without much to show for it.Yet Pomeranz, author of the The Great Divergence: China, Europe, and the Making of the Modern World Economy, says it was one of the best places on the planet for poor people to live until the eve of the industrial revolution., A listener wants to know why Ticketmaster charges a convenience fee if you want to print out the tickets you buy online. After all, it\'s your ink and paper, and you\'re not asking Ticketmaster to mail your purchase.Economist Emily Oster of the Chicago Booth School of Business has been decoding the universe for us, and she\'s got an answer for you. It\'s got to do with the network effect, locking up a market and \xe2\x80\x94 of course \xe2\x80\x94 supply and demand.If you\'ve got an economic riddle for Emily Oster, e-mail it to us at planetmoney@npr.org., Much of the debate over changing the U.S. health care system concerns the Americans who can\'t get care. But a majority of Americans have insurance of one type or another, and for them, the health care system often more closely resembles an all-you-can-eat buffet. As a consumer, you don\'t have to worry too a great deal about the price, to a point, because your employer pays much of your premiums and the insurer picks up much of the medical cost.David Goldhill, author of an Atlantic article called "How American Health Care Killed My Father," calculates that the average cost of a family\'s health insurance over a lifetime is $1.7 million. Goldhill proposes that Americans pay for routine care up to $50,000 over their lifetimes, and then be required to build health savings accounts that would cover the rest.Goldhill\'s idea strikes Richard Kirsch of Health Care for America Now as very dangerous proposition. He says you can\'t treat medicine like any other commodity., If any single player is driving the process for reforming financial regulation on Capitol Hill, it\'s Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.). The chair of the House Financial Services Committee tells Adam Davidson that bipartisan consensus on the issue is beyond reach.As you\'ll hear in this interview, Frank is an intense lawmaker with very definite ideas about politics and the art of the possible., China\'s all over the headlines these days, as its economy recovers faster than the U.S. one. World newspapers trumpet the communist nation\'s rise, with stories like "Asia recovery show\'s China\'s ascendance" and "China to surpass U.S. \'within a decade.\'"Analyst David Gordon, head of research at Eurasia Group, says it\'s true that the Chinese responded to the global recession with a fast, effective stimulus program. The rest is hype, Gordon says, since the China\'s economy is nowhere near big enough or dynamic enough to save the rest of the world.Plus: Listener Aimee Ennis checks in from her interrupted subdivision in Clover, South Carolina, where the developer is \xe2\x80\x94 gasp! \xe2\x80\x94 building homes again., If you find MySpace more chaotic than Facebook, that\'s no accident. Founders Chris DeWolfe and Tom Anderson wanted to create a site that\'s just as disorienting as your average nightclub, a crazy landscape of musicians and models and Hollywood desire, says Julia Angwin, author of Stealing Myspace: The Battle to Control the Most Popular Website in America.DeWolfe and Anderson came to their social networking juggernaut from the world of porn and spyware. Their greatest asset? Complete ignorance, Angwin says. Not knowing what to fear, the entrepreneurs just dove in. It gave them a great beginning \xe2\x80\x94 and an Achilles heel., Doctors know plenty about you and your ailments, but what do you know about them?. Robert Krughoff, of Consumer Checkbook, has a new website, Patient Central, that uses detailed survey information obtained by actual patients to measure doctor performance. Sometimes a little bit of information can be too much. Naked Economist Charlie Wheelan says knowing our genetic makeup is good for us but bad for the insurance industry. Wheelan argues that as soon as our insurance pool is "corrupted" by this information, healthy people will begin to opt out and people likely to get sick forced to opt in at higher rates., Before Bernie Madoff, there was the Antar family. The Antars ran the popular "Crazy Eddie" electronics chain, which was known for its frenetic commercials and low prices. The business was crooked from the start, but the fraud got more serious when the family took the company public in 1984. Eddie\'s nephew Sam Antar was one of the masterminds of the fraud. He explains how the family managed to cheat investors out of millions and why the scheme eventually fell apart., We started our debate on financial innovation a few weeks ago with Mike Konczal and Charles Calomiris. Today Tyler Cowen of Marginal Revolution and Felix Salmon of Reuters join Mike to answer the question: has financial innovation in the last 25 years has been positive or negative?Felix Salmon says that financial innovation was a good thing \xe2\x80\x94 until about 25 years ago, when it became a way for bankers to get around regulation. Tyler Cowen says that it\'s not financial innovations that caused economic calamities \xe2\x80\x94 it\'s the leverage \xe2\x80\x94 banks being able to borrow huge amounts of cash with little money down. While Mike Konczal argues that it\'s all about competition: if a rival bank comes up with a new innovation, you need to compete whether it\'s dangerous or not., Imagine two identical hospitals, side by side. One charges patients a little, and the other piles on the bills. Where do patients get better care? Researchers say that, overall, there\'s no connection between the intensity, quality or cost of treatment and how well patients fare.That\'s one of the biggest challenges in fixing health care \xe2\x80\x94 patients, doctors and insurance companies aren\'t all playing with the same information. As patients visiting a doctor, most of us are like drivers taking a car to the mechanic. If we had the know-how, we\'d fix it ourselves, but we don\'t and so we have to rely on someone else\'s judgment.With appearances by Deborah Kimbell of the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, Chana Joffe-Walt\'s mom, a sunglasses vendor in Manhattan, and mechanic Ari Cohen., Some days, you just have to wonder why the world is the way it is. Emily Oster is making a career out of training the lens of economics on just that question.Oster talks about her economic of analysis of AIDS and risky behavior in Africa, and she answers a riddle from a Planet Money listener. That riddle: Why, when prices are flat or falling, are restaurants piling more food on our plates?, Does the existence of hope unfulfilled make for a worse life? Medieval historian Philip Daileader says it might. People in places like 12th and 13th century France lived far more constrained economic lives than we do, but they had no expectations that their situations would ever improve., The cost of health care is rising faster than our economy is growing \xe2\x80\x94 it\'s an economic train wreck waiting to happen. The debate over fixing that situation rests on a couple of key questions, namely how do we get coverage for everyone and how do we control costs.That second question turns out to be much harder to answer. For all the talk about healing, a hospital is also a business. Cutting costs at a hospital falls to a hospital administrator like Daniel Kearns. He worked at a string of hospitals in the Southwest. Kearns says the hardest part of his job was dealing with doctors, like the one who wanted baseball season tickets for his family and the one who wanted a helicopter for transportation.Those may sound wacky, but Harvard health economist Tom McGuire, says neither patients, doctors nor hospitals have real incentives to trim expenses because they\'re all spending someone else\'s money., A lot of folks want to know who\'s to blame for the Great Recession. Investment manager Liaquat Ahamed says he knows who\'s to blame for the Great Depression.Ahamed, author of Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World, blames that economic collapse on the boneheaded policies of the leading central bankers. Ahamed says much of the problem stemmed with a return to the gold standard., The recession\'s showing signs of up, but the credit crisis isn\'t over. Banks still aren\'t lending like they used to, to families or businesses.Ira Jersey, head of U.S. interest rate strategy at RBC Capital Markets, can tell you why. Put simply, it\'s that families and businesses have borrowed too much already. They\'re continuing the long, slow and painful process of paying the debt down or writing it off., Congress has been arguing for months now about the best ways to overhaul the American system of financial regulation. It\'s a tough conversation, because regulation can be bad in a couple of ways.First, regulation can be ineffective, in which case it fails to prevent the outcomes it was designed to block or causes more problems than it solves. Second, regulation can overreach, in which case it stifles financial innovation.After newfangled financial products nearly brought down the global economy last fall, you might think it\'s not so bad to stifle financial innovation. But financial innovation has also led to prosperity. Atlantic writer Mike Konczal and Columbia Business School economist Charles Calomiris argue the pros and cons of Wall Street creativity., Almost a year into the financial crisis, we ask foreign policy analyst Ian Bremmer to take stock of America\'s position in the world. Bremmer, author of The Fat Tail and president of the risk consulting firm Eurasia Group, says America has lost some of its power.Bremmer gives two reasons for that. First, he says, other countries have recovered from the crisis more quickly. The second, he says, is that the crisis has forced U.S. leaders to pay more attention to domestic affairs and play a less active role on the global stage.On the upside, Bremmer says this is a great time to invest in Iraq., Before governments had regulators with suits and briefcases, says College of  William and Mary history professor Philip Daileader, they had knights. The Lancelots of real life went around the kingdom forcing people to pay whatever the knights decided they owed. It was a brutal economic approach.If you think the knights were tough, be thankful you never faced the guild system. It existed to eliminate competition and benefit producers at the expense of consumers. Craftspeople fought each other for control and tried to limit access to the market \xe2\x80\x94 at their own expense, it turned out., Goldman Sachs carries a certain mystique on Wall Street. The firm is known for hiring the brainiest people and paying them well. A number of its former executive have gone into politics, including former CEO Henry Paulson, who became President Bush\'s Treasury secretary, and former CEO Robert Rubin, an adviser to Presidents Clinton and Obama.This week, Goldman finished paying back its $10 billion federal TARP loan \xe2\x80\x94 with taxpayers pocketing a return of 23 percent. The firm also just released a fantastic report on its earnings, totaling $23 billion for the first half of 2009. Goldman is setting aside almost half of that money for paying its 30,000 employees. In rough terms, that amounts to almost $400,000 for each worker.Lucas Van Praag, a Goldman spokesperson, answers questions about other ways Goldman received government help and why it\'s rewarding the staff so richly after getting a hand from Uncle Sam.Plus: The stunning results from our Economic Radio Story Showdown., The rational school of economics holds that markets make sense. Sure, some people and businesses trade on raw, crazy emotions, but the mistakes cancel each other out. In the end, the rational school argues, market prices make sense.And then there\'s real life. Anyone who has spent any time looking at the stock market has to think there\'s at least a decent chance the whole thing is crazy \xe2\x80\x94 prices pinging around, investors making crazy bets, regulators trying to figure out who\'s flouting the byzantine rules.Justin Fox, a writer for Time and author of "The Myth of the Rational Market," talks about teddy bears, bubbles and Alan Greenspan., It looks like business lender CIT will be saved from bankruptcy by a $3 billion loan from its bondholders. The bondholders decided to step forward with the offer after the Treasury Department and the FDIC turned down the company\'s bids for help \xe2\x80\x94 apparently the government decided this institution was not too big too fail. Bill Dunkelberg, chief economist with the National Federation of Independent Business, explains how CIT got into trouble in the first place.Details of the deal are still being worked out and there is no guarantee the plan won\'t fall apart. A collapse of CIT could spell disaster for many of the nation\'s retailers who depend on the company for financing. National chains like Dunkin Donuts are clients and the company has even touted its aid to donut franchisees. Planet Money intern Matt Katz hit the streets of New York to find out what a world without donuts would look like., Robert Frank, author of the Economic Naturalist\'s Field Guide, lays out the benefits and problems of merit based pay using the Planet Money Staff as an example.

So far, President Obama says it\'s not needed. Stay tuned, says Eurasia Group\'s U.S. policy analyst Sean West. He argues that the administration will have to take some kind of action to get the economy going again. It\'s just that they might not call it a stimulus plan.Plus: Sen. Kent Conrad (D-ND) wants to know exactly what caused the economy calamity we\'re now living through. Conrad sponsored legislation to create the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, a panel with economic experts and no elected officials, to study the matter. The group returns with its findings ... in 2010., The planet\'s rich nations met this week to discuss, among other issues, ways to help the planet\'s poor nations.But those poor nations have their own group. It\'s called the anti-G20, in a nod to the G20 collection of industrialized states. The anti-G20 met at the U.N. last month, where Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz and Martin Khor explained what keeps impoverished countries down. Answer: Their debt to the IMF and wealthier nations.Plus: a second look at the surprisingly complex financial lives of the poor, with a focus on burial societies and very alternative banks., Economists at the World Bank calculate that 2.5 billion people live on $2 a day, but what exactly does that mean? In the developed world, living on so little would be almost unthinkable. For 40 percent of the global population, $2 a day is a reality that must, somehow, be made to work.In their book Portfolios of the Poor, Daryl Collins and co-author Jonathan Morduch uncover the surprisingly complex financial lives of the most destitute people., Should good teachers make more than bad ones? The Obama administration says the nation needs to start rewarding merit, and economist Michael Podgursky of the University of Missouri agrees. It\'s just that there\'s no simple means of carrying that out.Plus: A listener has an economic riddle. If colleges compete for students by making it easier to get degrees, then employers can\'t necessarily tell who\'s better qualified. What would an economist call this problem and how can it be fixed?

The question is, what makes a boss a good manager, and what makes a good manager a great leader?, TOPIC: How many Saturdays do you get?This week, Dan and Merlin talk about time. Its scarcity, its passing, its tyranny, and its possibilities., TOPIC: There are Only Two Prices: Free and What It CostsThis week, Dan and Merlin return to the classic lineup and some classic topics, including knowing your value, learning what to charge, and realizing what you can live with.Also: jury duty, traveling, bathrooms, the sliding scale of suffering, and what-have you., TOPIC: The Chinese Symbol for \'Pants\' Inside of The Chinese Symbol for \'Jury Duty.\'This week, Dan\'s away, so Merlin goes solo, taking a break from jury duty to talk about the opportunities that can be hiding inside change, inconvenience, and tumult., TOPIC: First Meeting, Gifts, and GriftsThis week\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94after 122 episodes, plus almost a decade of internet pal-dom\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94Dan and Merlin finally meet and record in a room together for the first time.With only passing nods to the nominal topic of "gifts," Dan and Merlin mostly get to know each other.Why is Dan staring so penetratingly at Merlin? Does Dan think Merlin is fat as well as old? Why does Dan keep looking at his phone? Does that look clean to you? Whose show is it, really? Is John Siracusa slender or sickly? Why can\'t I show you the sole of my shoe? Should we stand up? Who am I thinking of?  Is it hot in here or is it just me? Which one am I?Also, bathrooms.Inarguably, a Very Important Episode\xc3\xa2\xc2\x84\xc2\xa2., TOPIC: Loyalty, Altruism, Reality Check, or Extortion?This week, Dan and Merlin talk about what we talk about when we talk about "loyalty.", TOPIC: Dan\'s Recent Bathroom Incident, et al.This week, Dan and Merlin exhale. Don\'t search for secret doors., TOPIC: What would you do differently if you had a "safety net?"This week, Dan and Merlin congratulate their pal, Marco, on the acquisition of a company he helped co-found.Which leads to the nominal topic: what kind of safety net would you need to feel secure, do the things you\'d like, and mostly banish the more persistent cumulonimbus clouds of your own anxiety?Many angles are explored. Why was Elvis unhappy? How is habitual Schadenfreude and automatic bile ensmallening our culture? Can we ever be\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94let alone feel\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94truly secure? And, how much of our old selves do we end up lugging along inside every suitcase we carry?Pretty great episode. Especially if you like the ones where Merlin gets all mad. Those are usually good ones., TOPIC: Macintosh Nostalgia and Utter Apple ID Madness.This week, after an entirely appropriate amount of very important follow-up, Dan and Merlin talk about Susan Kare\'s original Mac icons, why they\'re not going to be appearing on John Siracusa\'s t-shirt, plus the litany of completely monkeyballs problems that now has Merlin  ready to literally shoot his Apple ID in the back of the head, mob-style., TOPIC: Toward an (Admittedly Dubious) Unified Field Theory of CreativityThis week, Dan and Merlin consider a framework for understanding the basic modes and focal lengths involved in producing creative work.Why and how do we get so hung up and frustrated about getting good at what we do? Why\'s it so hard to take an abstract idea for making something great, then end up feeling pathologically stymied when we struggle to actually make it?The boys return to the classic topic of expertise, especially the frustrating ironies that separate the pro from the amateur from the, as they say, "failure."Also under consideration is Roger Von Oech\'s fascinating modal, character-based approach to making stuff\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94acknowledging the very different work of the Explorer, Artist, Judge, and Warrior. But, critically, also striving to keep those characters in the right order and on the right parts of the right task at the right time. Then, knowing when to change things up.Finally, there\'s a bit of discussion on Merlin\'s squirrely obsession with focal length\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94to not only choose the right mode at the right time, but to stay open to the idea of alternately zooming way out and way in at each step of the process. Accepting the benefits and trade-offs of switching between your macro and fish-eye lenses.It\'s a really good episode\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94at least way better than it sounds. And, the hosts agree that, until you find a better model for understanding How to Make Stuff, you could do a lot worse than giving this admittedly Byzantine method a spin for yourself., TOPIC: Offices, and when to get out of them.This week\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94in what will surely be remembered as the greatest Back to Work episode of all time\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94Dan and Merlin eventually talk about working at a desk and when to take it someplace else., TOPIC: Quit &amp;amp; Analyze, and Marvel Character Speculation.This week, Dan and Merlin talk about Dan\'s "Quit &amp;amp; Analyze" episode, then proceed into a very useful conversation about which characters from the Marvel Universe they\'re each most like., TOPIC: Fixing the Culture of MeetingsThis week, Dan and Merlin address the problems with meetings, and how we can each choose to improve them.Ten quick ideas?PurposeAgendaGrazing PolicyHard EdgesScheduling GuestsTimekeeperNo RatholesFocusFollow-UpConsistency, TOPIC: Quicksilver and the OS X App Launcher LandscapeThis week, Dan triumphantly returns from two weeks of crippling illness. So, the boys ease their way back into the groove with a grab bag of great follow-up, some Adventure Time talk, and a longer discussion of popular OS X App launchers, including Quicksilver 1.0, LaunchBar, and Alfred 2., TOPIC: Drafts for iOS, and Who You Want to BeThis week, Dan and Merlin cover two very different topics.First, there\'s a detailed discussion of one of Merlin\'s favorite iOS apps, Drafts, including a deep dive on the app\'s extraordinary interactions with everything from Twitter to calendars to Dropbox.Second, Dan and Merlin have an A-plus conversation on the hardest question you&amp;#8217;ll ask yourself this week: &amp;#8220;Is this who I want to be?&amp;#8221;, TOPIC: Choosing Your Forks.This week, Dan and Merlin talk about some of the deeper and more slippery issues behind changes in our career and life.In particular, how do we go from a vague tickle to that feeling of full-blown intolerability that can end up driving a change? Are we looking backward at what we should be doing as we slavishly catalog our many petty aggrievements? Or, do we take two giant steps back and apply a cooler eye to what we really want to do next?Even before we find our forks in the road, how can we know a big decision might or should be coming our way? And, how do we stay current on that never-ending need to accept and plan for the changes we never could  have anticipated?It\'s tough at 23, it\'s super-hard at 30, and, brother, is it ever murder at 50.Sure, it\'s a little fruity, but, yeah: you need to write the story you really want to live. Rather than just cobbling together a flattering post-mortem on how you magically ended up where you are., TOPIC: Memory.This week, Dan and Merlin try to tackle the complexities of memory.Why do we remember things from childhood with unimpeachable detail, but then forget our own phone number or PIN code? How can the same person remember the name of everyone he\'s ever met, and then space a phone call a couple hours after it was scheduled? Why do we remember and why do we forget?Unsurprisingly, few concrete answers appear, but there\'s plenty of lively conversation on savant syndrome, tactical memory aides, and the precise location of Merlin\'s pills., TOPIC: Stupidity.This week, Dan and Merlin tackle stupidity. And, brother, there sure are a whole lot of flavors of stupid.Are we really talking about being clueless, unaware, dumb, absent-minded, or just plain-old ignorant? Because they\'re actually pretty different animals.Whether you\'re dropping your library book in the mailbox, leaving your iPad at home, following baseless medical advice, or doing whatever Dan did with his garage door (don\'t worry: the car is fine), it\'s really helpful to understand where your real problem really lives.From a tactical standpoint, try some useful failsafes, rituals, and habits. But, at a higher level, learn to develop the curiosity to keep evolving. Stay open to how you might be wrong by always seeking out the smartest person you can find who disagrees with you., TOPIC: Not So MuchThis week, Dan and Merlin eschew \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9ctopic\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d to freely discuss razors, beef, They Might Be Giants, prolapse, Genesis, dogs, Spider-Man (and -Womyn), pretender marteenies, truck butt, the lonely plaster casts of our youth, blind harmonicists, those awesome blue IKEA bags, ceviche, E.L.O., Goldenberg\'s Peanut Chews, bumping, hypoglycemia, how Merlin named his daughter, Hyman Roth, endive,  and, of course, The Big Lebowski.Then, they go and blow it all by unintentionally having a really useful discussion about Merlin\'s three key elements of optimal and sustainable workflows., TOPIC: Shaving a YakThis week, Dan and Merlin talk about The Hierarchy of Fiddling. When does self-improvement silently shade into navel-gazing, and how do we realize that it\'s happening?Some fixes mean applying a fast change that produces outsized results (a true "life hack"). But, most of our more circuitous excursions into the world of \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cproductivity\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d lead straight into a recursive black hole of lost time, sheer frustration, and soul-sucking existential onanism (let\'s call that one a "life whack").Learn how to live with your dirty debit card, just satisfice with your dish-washing skills, and quit trying to solve non-problems with non-solutions.Yes, learn the key commands, but, don\'t feel like you need to learn all the key commands. Iterate with mindful sanity.And, like it says on the tin: always focus on how you\'ll get back to work., TOPIC: CompressionThis week, Dan and Merlin talk about compression.  What happens when we don\'t account for how long something really takes to do?

aS'The TED Radio Hour is a journey through fascinating ideas: astonishing inventions, fresh approaches to old problems, new ways to think and create. Based on Talks given by riveting speakers on the world-renowned TED stage, each show is centered on a common theme - such as the source of happiness, crowd-sourcing innovation, power shifts, or inexplicable connections. The TED Radio Hour is hosted by Guy Raz, and is a co-production of NPR &amp; TED. Follow the show @TEDRadioHour., &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong id="docs-internal-guid-3c50d783-85af-79c4-9ff4-6b308219c9fd" style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"&gt;There are problems affecting big parts of our lives that seem intractable. From politics, to healthcare, to law and the justice system \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 some things just don&amp;#8217;t seem to work as they should. In this hour, TED speakers share some big ideas on how to solve the seemingly impossible. Attorney Philip K. Howard argues the U.S. has become a legal minefield and we need to simplify our laws. Legal scholar Lawrence Lessig says corruption is at the heart of American politics and issues a bipartisan call for change. Health advocate Rebecca Onie describes how our healthcare system can be restructured to not just treat \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 but prevent \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 illness. Lawyer Bryan Stevenson explains how America&amp;#8217;s criminal justice system works against the poor and people of color, and how we can address it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-51d2f0d4-5db3-2e7e-8267-66921cbd63e1" style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;In this hour, TED speakers question whether we can experience the world more deeply by not only extending our senses \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 but going beyond them. Color blind artist Neil Harbisson can "hear" colors, even those beyond the range of sight. Physician and engineer Todd Kuiken builds prosthetic arms that connect with the human nervous system \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 improving motion, control and even feeling. Speech scientist Rupal Patel creates customized synthetic voices that enable people who can&amp;#8217;t speak to communicate in a unique voice that embodies who they are. Sound expert Julian Treasure says we are losing our listening in a louder world. He shares ways to re-tune our ears for conscious listening \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 to other people and the world around us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;In this hour, TED speakers explore our origins as a species \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 who we are, where we come from, where we&amp;#8217;re headed \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 and how we&amp;#8217;re connected to everything that came before us. Geneticist Spencer Wells describes how he uses DNA samples to trace our individual origins going back 2,000 generations. David Christian explains the history of the universe from the Big Bang, and how humans occupy little more than a millisecond on that cosmic timeline. Paleontologist Jack Horner explains what dinosaurs tell us about our own origins and what we can learn by attempting to revive a piece of the past. Louise Leakey describes her and her family&amp;#8217;s long search for early human remains in Africa, and how unlocking that mystery is the key to understanding our survival as a species. Geneticist Spencer Wells returns to tell the story of early humans, and our eventual migration from Africa. Juan Enriquez argues that human evolution is far from over \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 homo sapiens are becoming a new species right before our eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Whether you call them Millennials, Generation Y, or the Me Generation, one thing\'s for certain: today\'s generation of young people will change the world. But how different is this hyper-connected generation from its predecessors? And what will be its legacy? In this hour, we hear from TED speakers searching to define themselves and their generation. Demographer Neil Howe coined the term &amp;#8220;Millennial&amp;#8221; in 1991, and offers perspective on the now-loaded term. Activist Natalie Warne calls on young people to find their passion, chase after it, and not let age stop them from changing the world. Psychologist Meg Jay tells twentysomethings how to reclaim adulthood before it&amp;#8217;s too late. Charlie Hoehn explains how he built a career on his own terms at the height of the economic recession. YouTube Trends Manager Kevin Allocca describes how this generation is using technology to warp the way we consume media. And teenager and RookieMag.com editor-in-chief Tavi Gevinson talks about the need for an unapologetically uncertain, complex idea of feminism for today\'s teenage girls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-fe68481e-c863-c600-d765-fb8d34194e7d" style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Visions of the future don&amp;#8217;t just have to come from science fiction. There&amp;#8217;s very real technology today giving us clues about how our future lives might be transformed. So what might our future be like? And what does it take for an idea about the future to become a reality? In this hour, TED speakers make some bold predictions and explain how our future lives might look. Technology leader Nicholas Negroponte looks back on predictions he made in 1984, with surprising accuracy. Tissue engineer Nina Tandon says in the future, we&amp;#8217;ll be able to grow replacement organs. Entrepreneur Richard Resnick says faster genome sequencing will revolutionize how we treat disease. Global security consultant Marc Goodman explains how advancing technology will change how we fight crime. GPS expert Todd Humphreys forecasts the future of geo-locators and how it will change our notions of privacy. Also, Sebastian Thrun says we will see more driverless cars on the road in the next decade, and soon traffic jams and accidents will be a thing of the past.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-a0f1da2a-d24a-ef79-5185-795031f10b40" style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Everyone wants to be creative. But channeling your creative impulses is no small feat. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #222222; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Is creativity something you are born with or can you learn it? In this hour, TED speakers examine the mystery of creativity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;After a nasty bout of writer&amp;#8217;s block that stretched on for nearly a decade, Sting found inspiration by channeling the stories of the shipyard workers he knew from his childhood.

But who holds the reins over our personal information? And does it matter if it&amp;#8217;s collected by government, by a search engine, or if we willingly give it away? In this hour, TED speakers explore ideas about our changing notions of privacy, the consequences and benefits. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;When Hasan Elahi&amp;#8217;s name was mistakenly added to the U.S. government&amp;#8217;s watch list, he fought the assault on his privacy by turning his life inside-out for the world to see. Hacker and security expert Mikko Hypp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #111111; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&amp;#246;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;nen says virtually every international internet user is being watched \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 and he makes the case for privacy in the age of government surveillance. Former U.S. Deputy Chief Technology Officer Beth Noveck shares her vision of practical openness &amp;#8211; connecting bureaucracies to citizens, and creating a truly participatory democracy. Health IT expert John Wilbanks explores whether the desire to protect privacy is slowing research, and if opening up medical data could create a wave of health care innovation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Behavioral economist Alessandro Acquisti explains how everyday decisions contribute to blurring the line between our public and private lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Are we simply the sum of our experiences? Or can we choose our own path? In this hour, TED speakers share stories of undergoing remarkable transformations despite extraordinary challenges.&amp;#160; Zak Ebrahim tells the story of being raised to hate, as the son of terrorist El-Sayyid Nosair, and how he chose a different path. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Fashion model Geena Rocero talks about being born a boy, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;becoming who she was meant to be.

In this hour, TED speakers explore how curiosity leads to unexpected places. Director James Cameron\'s blockbuster films create unreal worlds. He reveals his childhood fascinations and how they fueled the passion behind his movies. Designer Thomas Thwaites explains what compelled him to build a toaster, literally from the ground up. Geneticist Wendy Chung describes what it&amp;#8217;s like to chip away at the mysteries of autism, and the excitement of uncovering tiny but critical clues. &amp;#160;Biologist Nathan Wolfe says the unseeable world of microbes is fertile ground for new discoveries. &amp;#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Mythbusters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt; co-host Adam Savage talks about three people who inspired him to be curious: his dad, a former Earth Science teacher, and physicist Richard Feynman. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-c07b0574-4160-c0b0-6adb-c1c951393149" style="font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;In this hour, TED speakers explore the complex relationships we have with animals. Writer Jon Mooallem tells the story of the teddy bear and considers how the tales we tell about wild animals have real consequences for a species\' chance of survival &amp;#8212; and the natural world at large. Animal trainer Ian Dunbar says we need to see the world through the eyes of our dogs if we want them to behave better. Poet Billy Collins imagines the inner life of a former canine companion. S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial; background-color: #ffffff; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;cience historian Laurel Braitman explores why some animals get anxious, depressed, and stressed out. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Biologist Frans de Waal studies how primates display other human traits, such as empathy, cooperation, and fairness.&amp;#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Learning is an integral part of human nature. But why do we \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 as adults \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 assume learning must be taught, tested and reinforced? Why do we put so much effort in making kids think and act like us? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #333333; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;In this hour, TED speakers explore the different ways babies and children learn on their own \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 from the womb, to the playground, to the web. Education researcher Sugata Mitra explains how he brought self-supervised access to the web for children in India&amp;#8217;s slums and villages \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 with results that have made him rethink teaching. Science writer Annie Murphy Paul discusses how fetuses begin taking cues from the outside world while still in the womb. Developmental psychologist Alison Gopnik argues that like scientists, babies and young children follow a sophisticated systematic process of exploration when they play. Veteran teacher Rita Pierson says children need relationships and human connection in order to be inspired to learn. Sugata Mitra returns later in the episode to talk about his vision to build a school in a cloud where children drive a new kind of self-organized classroom.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p id="docs-internal-guid-c73b2774-eec5-24ad-bf44-4993ccf3c8fb" dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;We try so hard to be perfect, to never make mistakes and to avoid failure at all costs. But mistakes happen. And when they do, how do we deal with being wrong? In this episode, TED speakers look at those darker moments in our lives, and consider why sometimes we need to make mistakes and face them head on. Dr. Brian Goldman tells a profound story about the first big mistake he made in the ER, and questions medicine\'s culture of denial. Professor Bren&amp;#233; Brown explains how important it is to confront shame. Also, jazz composer Stefon Harris argues that a lot of our actions are seen as mistakes only because we don\'t react to them appropriately. Plus, Margaret Heffernan, the former CEO of five businesses, tells the story of two unexpected collaborators, and how good disagreement is central to progress.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;This recording of "Beauty and the Brain," a session hosted by Guy Raz at TED 2014, brings popular speakers back to the TED stage with updates on their work and personal lives.&amp;#160; Tierney Thys talks about how being in the natural world engages your brain; Dan Gilbert discusses why we so often make decisions that our future selves regret; Jane McGonigal explores a video game that is better than morphine at relieving pain; seventeen-year-old Taylor Wilson details his progress on the nuclear reactor he built in his garage; and Jill Bolte Taylor, the neuro-scientist who lived through a stroke, explains how her life has changed since her TED Talk went viral.&amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-f4a76d67-d4e5-a238-066f-cdca6a9b093a" style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;We all want to find happiness, but it seems elusive. Can we learn more about happiness through science? Or are there simpler ways to achieve it? Host Guy Raz feels happy listening to Pharrell&amp;#8217;s song &amp;#8220;Happy&amp;#8221;, so Guy asked Pharrell to share his ideas on happiness. Then we hear from five TED speakers who contemplate different paths to finding happiness. Researcher Matt Killingsworth says we\'re often happiest when we\'re lost in the moment. Journalist Carl Honore believes our society\'s emphasis on speed erodes our quality of life. Writer Graham Hill makes the case for taking up less space. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&amp;#160;Psychologist Dan Gilbert challenges the idea that we&amp;#8217;ll be miserable if we don&amp;#8217;t get what we want. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&amp;#160;Brother David Steindl-Rast reflects on slowing down, looking where you&amp;#8217;re going, and being grateful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p id="docs-internal-guid-71139fd8-a6a0-810e-5f63-58d440773a05" dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Violence and brutality are grim realities of life. So why are some people violent, and others aren&amp;#8217;t? Are some of us born that way, or can anyone be pushed into committing acts of cruelty? What would it take for an ordinary person to become violent? In this hour, TED speakers explore the sinister side of human nature, and whether we&amp;#8217;re all capable of violence. Psychologist Philip Zimbardo tells the story of his notorious Stanford Prison experiment and how easy it is for people to turn violent. Neuroscientist Jim Fallon uncovers the wiring of a psychopathic killer. Writer Leslie Morgan Steiner tells the harrowing story of her abusive relationship, and shares why victims of domestic violence often don&amp;#8217;t leave. Psychology professor Steven Pinker charts the whole of human history, and says we are living in the most peaceful time in our existence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;As adults, we experience childhood as a series of flashbacks. And those memories \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 however few and faulty \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 form the foundation of who we are. In this hour, TED speakers reflect on how our upbringing shapes us.&amp;#160; Tinkering School Founder Gever Tulley says that when kids are given sharp &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;tools and matches, their imaginations take off and they become better problem-solvers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Journalist Jennifer Senior argues that the goal of raising happy children is so elusive that it has put modern, middle-class parents into a panic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Poet and playwright Lemn Sissay was raised by the state; he talks about the empty space where his family should have been.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt; Writer Andrew Solomon dives into his childhood to describe moments of great adversity, and how they helped him forge an identity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-2da448ac-68f0-ed1f-812a-c2daf193d887" style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Is leadership only reserved for the extraordinary few? Who has what it takes to disrupt the status quo? In this hour, TED speakers share ideas about what it takes to forge a new path. Four-star general Stanley McChrystal recounts some tough lessons about leadership he gained from the front lines. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg gets to the bottom line for women who want to lead. Bunker Roy created a school in India that equips rural women for leadership by training them to become solar engineers, artisans, dentists and doctors. Drew Dudley calls on us to celebrate leadership as the everyday act of improving each other&amp;#8217;s lives. Seth Godin believes the Internet gives ordinary people the power to lead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-e00b8aa7-454c-0deb-5bff-cb1de1ef4c7b" style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;From Little League to the Olympics, athletic mastery plays a major role in our sense of achievement. But how do elite athletes push the limits of speed, strength and endurance? In this hour, TED speakers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt; explore the minds and bodies of champions who achieve extraordinary physical feats, over and over again. Long-distance swimmer Diana Nyad takes us on the journey of her historic swim from Cuba to Florida at age 64. Sports journalist David Epstein explores the technology, genetics, and willpower that allow champions to break new records each year. Paralympic snowboarder Amy Purdy talks about how losing her legs at age 19 enabled her to achieve more than she ever dreamed. Historian Sarah Lewis explains why the near-win motivates us to keep going.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Science and technology now allow us to "hack" solutions to the biggest challenges of our time. But how far is too far? And what are the consequences of these hacks? In this hour, we hear stories from TED speakers who dare to hack the brain, the climate, and even the animal kingdom in hopes of creating a better world. Computer security expert Mikko Hypp&amp;#246;nen describes how he discovered the first PC virus and what he learned about protecting the Internet today. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Environmentalist Stewart Brand says we now have the technology to bring back some of the species that humanity has wiped out. Climate scientist David Keith proposes a cheap and surprising way to address climate change. Inventor Jay Silver encourages everyone to play with the world around us. Neurosurgeon Andres Lozano talks about dramatic findings in deep brain stimulation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p id="docs-internal-guid-d34f7adc-f7bd-a8c3-83f6-fc64b1e210ba" dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Gazing up at the night sky is simultaneously humbling and utterly thrilling. This hour, we&amp;#8217;ll hear from TED speakers who share an infectious sense of wonder and curiosity about our place in the universe and what lies beyond our skies. Phil Plait breaks down how we can defend Earth from an asteroid. Jill Tarter of the SETI Institute explains why it&amp;#8217;s crucial for humans here on earth to continue searching for sentient beings in the cosmos. Physicist Brian Greene unravels the strange tale of dark matter and why our universe may be one of many in the &amp;#8220;multiverse.&amp;#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-48d40b87-d945-ceae-2d02-7c3e79fdea68" style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Even the most original ideas are essentially remixes.&amp;#160; When is copying flattery, when is it thievery, and when is it sheer genius? In this hour, TED speakers explore how sampling, borrowing, and riffing make all of us innovators. Sampling music isn\'t about "hijacking nostalgia wholesale," says DJ Mark Ronson. It\'s about inserting yourself into the narrative of a song while pushing that story forward. Filmmaker Kirby Ferguson says nothing is original and that our most celebrated creators steal ideas \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 and transform them into something new. Clothing designs aren&amp;#8217;t protected by copyright \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 and the industry benefits by being more innovative, says Johanna Blakley. People often credit their ideas to individual "Eureka!" moments. But writer Steven Johnson shows how history tells a different story. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-9a94574e-b4d1-ddd1-2a60-85ec86c63895" style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s face it: people lie. &amp;#160;We lie to each other and to ourselves. Is there a deeper reason why we do it? &amp;#160;In this episode, TED speakers deconstruct the hard truths of deception. Behavioral economist Dan Ariely explains the hidden reasons we think it\'s okay to cheat or steal. Pamela Meyer points out manners and cues that can help us suss out a lie. Technology might actually force us to be more honest, says psychologist Jeff Hancock. Michael Shermer says the human tendency to believe strange things boils down to two of the brain\'s most basic, hard-wired survival skills. Magician Eric Mead extends the placebo effect to magic, pulling off a gruesome trick that&amp;#8217;s so convincing, you&amp;#8217;ll cringe. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-efb40772-90e4-77ec-e918-a9d5b6d5bfeb" style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-efb40772-90e4-77ec-e918-a9d5b6d5bfeb" style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;We all have our struggles, whether they be mental, physical, or social. But what is it that makes some of us keep trying and striving to overcome despite the odds? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #222222; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;In this hour, TED speakers tell their stories about overcoming a weakness and turning it into a strength. Temple Grandin talks about how she struggled with autism for years until she realized that her ability to &amp;#8220;think in pictures&amp;#8221; allows her to solve problems that many others might miss. Shane Koyczan describes being tormented endlessly by bullies, but when he turned to spoken word poetry as an adult, he found a community of fans eager to embrace him for his anti-bullying message. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Eleanor Longden recounts how her life was spiraling out of control when she was diagnosed with schizophrenia, hospitalized, and drugged \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 until she learned to listen to and live with her voices. Kakenya Ntaiya tells the fearless story of challenging ingrained traditions, insisting to continue her education, and becoming the first girl to leave her Maasai village for college.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Our daily lives depend on travel: walking, biking, driving, flying. In the future, we&amp;#8217;ll make tough compromises and bold leaps of faith to travel smarter, cleaner, and faster. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #222222; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;In this hour, TED speakers reimagine the future of getting there.&amp;#160; Explorer Bertrand Piccard explains why he&amp;#8217;s aiming to carry out an unprecedented mission: to circle the planet in a solar-powered airplane.

But how do we distinguish between fear and danger?

But what motivates dozens, thousands, even millions of people to come together on the Internet and commit their time to a project for free? &amp;#160;What is the key to making a successful collaboration work? In this hour, TED speakers unravel ideas behind the mystery of mass collaborations that build a better world. Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales explains what drives people everywhere to contribute to the self-organizing online encyclopedia. Computer programmer Luis von Ahn builds systems that combine humans and computers to help digitize books and translate the web. Social media guru Clay Shirky says when we contribute to the web, we&amp;#8217;re building a better world. Software entrepreneur Jason Fried thinks collaboration is key to productivity, as long as we do away with meetings. And coder Jennifer Pahlka believes the government be run like the Internet: permissionless and open.&amp;#160; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-842489e2-dc65-86b5-1718-e2b05dea22a5" style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Brands help us assign value to almost everything we buy. But is there a way to know the difference between real and created value? In this episode, TED speakers explore the seductive power of brands. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Filmmaker Morgan Spurlock tells the story of his quest to make a completely sponsored film-- about sponsorship.

But how did the origins of language influence action, and can words actually change human behavior, even alter the course of history? &amp;#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;In this hour, TED speakers reflect on how our words and methods of communication affect us, more than you might expect. &amp;#160;Linguist John McWhorter says that texting has come of age with such speed and force that it\'s created an entirely new language within a generation. Biologist Mark Pagel believes our complex language system is a piece of "social technology", simply created to help us get things done. Teacher Phuc Tran tells a personal story of how being caught in a world between the subjunctive and indicative tense \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 yes, grammar \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 helped him find his identity. Etymologist Mark Forsyth shares the surprising back story of the word "president." &amp;#160;Social psychologist Amy Cuddy explains how &amp;#8220;power posing&amp;#8221; can affect our brains, and might even have an impact on our success.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-465c91bf-9553-cb73-6a5d-bb3f08829d70" style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Love is instinctive and essential. We need it to keep our species going, to survive childhood, to create bonds with other people. But what is it that brings certain people together? &amp;#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #222222; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;In this hour, TED speakers &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;examine the mystery of connection and relationships. Amy Webb was having no luck with online dating, until she effectively hacked the system. &amp;#160;Anthropologist Helen Fisher questions what happens in our brains when we\'re in love. Therapist Esther Perel says a good relationship draws on both security and surprise. Writer Jeffrey Kluger explores the profound life-long bond between siblings. Angela Patton tells the story of a unique father-daughter dance. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000;"&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-7d365b26-6bd1-afb1-3a72-526b23c1dda0" style="font-family: Arial; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Why do some of us believe, and some of us don&amp;#8217;t? Can our doubts bring our beliefs into sharper focus? Do we all need to believe in something, and to seek meaning by creating rituals, myths and symbols? And what is the difference between belief and faith? In this hour, TED speakers offer personal perspectives on belief from all ends of the spectrum, from ardent atheists to the devout faithful. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Anne Graham Lotz, the daughter of Billy Graham, reflects on her father&amp;#8217;s faith and lifelong devotion to God. Writer Lesley Hazleton calls for a new appreciation of doubt as the foundation of faith. Julia Sweeney talks about how two Mormon missionaries made her completely rethink her own beliefs. Alain de Botton says "Atheism 2.0" could satisfy our human need for connection and ritual. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Devdutt Pattanaik examines the East vs West approach to life through the lens of mythology. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-a4f82c3c-431c-9803-e185-ea17b5e5f23e" style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Stories ignite our imagination, let us leap over cultural walls and cross the barriers of time. Stories affirm who we are, and allow us to experience the similarities between ourselves and others, real or imagined. Stories help us make meaning of our lives. In this hour, TED speakers explore the art of storytelling \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 and how good stories have the power to transform our perceptions of the world. Novelist Tracy Chevalier explains how she discovers a compelling story from inside a painting. Graphic designer Chip Kidd creates &amp;#8220;visual haikus&amp;#8221; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 book covers that, in a single image, tell the story inside. Writer Chimamanda Adichie warns that if we hear only a single story about another person, we risk a critical misunderstanding. Plus, filmmaker Andrew Stanton says good storytelling is starting at the end and working back to the beginning. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-27c22cfa-288a-2cf6-1f9b-ab01c916659c" style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;What does money tell us about human nature? How does it motivate, trick, satisfy and disappoint us? On this episode, TED speakers share insights into our relationship with money. Psychologist Laurie Santos studies human irrationality by observing how primates make decisions \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 including some not-so-savvy money choices their human relatives often make. Behavioral economist Keith Chen says languages that don&amp;#8217;t have a future tense strongly correlate with higher savings. Social psychologist Paul Piff describes how almost anyone&amp;#8217;s behavior can change when they&amp;#8217;re made to feel rich. Career analyst and writer Daniel Pink explains why traditional rewards like money aren\'t always successful motivators. Social scientist Michael Norton researches how money can buy happiness &amp;#8212; the key is social spending that benefits not just you, but other people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-6b9adcaf-fa94-9d93-b8ce-dcc7070b9aed" style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;There are some truths that we believe in wholeheartedly \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 but what if we&amp;#8217;re completely wrong? Once we separate fact from fiction, how do our perceptions change? &amp;#160;In this hour, TED speakers move beyond conventional wisdom to reveal complex realities about what we &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;think&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt; we know to be true. Author Malcolm Gladwell reveals an alternative account of David and Goliath that flips the story on its head. Reporter Leslie T. Chang debunks how we assume Chinese factory workers feel. Ecologist Allan Savory counters everything conventional wisdom tells us about how grasslands lose their life to desertification. Reporter Jennifer 8. Lee talks about her hunt for the actual origins of Chinese-American food. Psychologist Barry Schwartz says having more options doesn\'t make us happier \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 it actually paralyzes us. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-5093cc9a-ad60-efa3-1b4e-25bc98199619" style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Success has become synonymous with financial wealth, influence and status. But can we define success in another way \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 one that welcomes a broader range of accomplishment? It may not be as obvious as you think. In this hour, TED speakers share ideas for what makes us successful. Life coach Tony Robbins describes why failure should not be an option. Psychologist Angela Lee Duckworth says "grit", not IQ, is the new predictor of success. Mike Rowe encourages us not to follow our passion. Ron Gutman shares some compelling research on the hidden power of smiling. And writer Alain de Botton shares a fascinating view about the American paradigm for success and failure. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-501530ef-bce0-9d5b-44e9-37e18260338e" style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;There are problems affecting big parts of our lives that seem intractable. From politics, to health care, to law and the justice system \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 some things just don&amp;#8217;t seem to work as they should. In this hour, TED speakers share some big ideas on how to solve the seemingly impossible. Attorney Philip K. Howard argues the U.S. has become a legal minefield and we need to simplify our laws. Legal scholar Lawrence Lessig says corruption is at the heart of American politics and issues a bipartisan call for change. Health advocate Rebecca Onie describes how our health care system can be restructured to not just treat \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 but prevent \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 illness. Lawyer Bryan Stevenson explains how America&amp;#8217;s criminal justice system works against the poor and people of color, and how we can address it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-19dbb294-98f3-d49a-635c-8fbf342a8b80" style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;In this hour, TED speakers question whether we can experience the world more deeply by not only extending our senses \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 but going beyond them. Color blind artist Neil Harbisson can "hear" colors, even those beyond the range of sight. Physician and engineer Todd Kuiken builds prosthetic arms that connect with the human nervous system \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 improving motion, control and even feeling. Speech scientist Rupal Patel creates customized synthetic voices that enable people who can&amp;#8217;t speak to communicate in a unique voice that embodies who they are. Sound expert Julian Treasure says we are losing our listening in a louder world. He shares ways to retune our ears for conscious listening \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 to other people and the world around us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;We\'ve been &lt;span id="internal-source-marker_0.9248116187089253"&gt;promised a future where robots will be our friends, and technology will make life&amp;#8217;s daily chores as easy as flipping a switch. But are we ready for how those innovations will change us as humans? In this episode, TED speakers consider the promises and perils of our relationship with technology.&lt;/span&gt; Psychologist Sherry Turkle looks at how devices and online personas are redefining human connection. Robotics engineer Cynthia Breazeal talks about building robots that teach, learn, and play. Research Scientist Andrew McAfee examines how technology affects the labor market, today and in the future. Physician and writer Abraham Verghese describes our strange new world where patients are data points, and calls for a return to the traditional physical exam.

But is identity assigned at birth? Shaped by circumstance? Or is it something we choose that changes over time? In this hour, TED speakers describe their journeys to answer the question: who am I? Entrepreneur Tan Le recounts her family&amp;#8217;s harrowing journey from Vietnam to Australia, and how it defined her identity. Writer Andrew Solomon has interviewed dozens of parents, and he talks about what it&amp;#8217;s like to raise a child whose identity is fundamentally different from yours. Novelist Elif Shafak describes how fiction has allowed her to explore many different lives, to jump over cultural walls, and how it may have the power to overcome identity politics. Writer Pico Iyer meditates on the meaning of home in a world where the boundaries of nation-states no longer apply. (Rebroadcast)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-434fd0d9-2c85-889b-274f-c0152fa07127" style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;We all want to find happiness, but it seems elusive. Can we learn more about happiness through science? Or are there simpler ways to achieve it? Host Guy Raz feels happy listening to Pharrell&amp;#8217;s song &amp;#8220;Happy&amp;#8221;, so Guy asked Pharrell to share his ideas on happiness. Then we hear from five TED speakers who contemplate different paths to finding happiness. Researcher Matt Killingsworth says we\'re often happiest when we\'re lost in the moment. Journalist Carl Honore believes our society\'s emphasis on speed erodes our quality of life. Writer Graham Hill makes the case for taking up less space. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Psychologist Dan Gilbert challenges the idea that we&amp;#8217;ll be miserable if we don&amp;#8217;t get what we want. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Brother David Steindl-Rast reflects on slowing down, looking where you&amp;#8217;re going, and being grateful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]'

The electricity from the affected line was diverted to another line. This was fairly normal and everything was fine\xe2\x80\x94until a second bolt of lightening struck.Electric lines started shutting themselves off. As more and more lines were shut off, the system started to shut itself down. Eventually, the largest power generator in the area, known as Big Allis, turned itself off.And then all of New York City went dark.On that evening, DJ Grandmaster Caz, a Bronx native, was spinning records in a park. Caz recalls the evening: "The record just started slowing down, you know what I mean? So, quite naturally, we thought, it was us. We thought we had drained too much power and we shorted out the electricity. So we\'re frantic, we\'re looking around, we\'re checking buttons, were checking switches, we\'re seeing what\'s up.""It was chaos that night," says Grandmaster Caz. "And it was exciting afterwards. But while it was going on, it was scary."But Caz also believes that the the 1977 blackout may have accelerated the burgeoning Hip Hop movement. His theory: the looting that occurred during the blackout enabled people who couldn\'t afford turntables and mixers to become DJs.Please support the Radiotopia Kickstarter today!, Everyone has tried it at some point.

Building in straight lines makes predicting costs and calculating structural loads easier, since building materials come in linear units.Straight lines might be logical, predictable, and efficient, but they are also completely "godless"\xe2\x80\x94at least according to Austrian artist and designer Tausendsassa Friedensreich Regentag Dunkelbunt Hundertwasser (which translates to "Multi-Talented Peace-Filled Rainy Day Dark-Colored Hundred Waters\xe2\x80\x9d in German).Hundertwasser made a name for himself, so to speak, with his psychedelic, whimsical paintings and his public speaking engagements that he would sometimes deliver completely naked.As a proponent of radical human expression, Hundertwasser sought to create structures that were free from straight lines, which he saw as constricting and devoid of organic elements., There\xe2\x80\x99s a photograph we have tacked to our studio at 99% Invisible HQ. The photo, taken 1899, shows three men, all looking very fashionable, suspended mid-air on the lifted arm of a giant dredging machine.There are plenty of images like this from this era\xe2\x80\x94 scenes of people standing around proudly as they shaped the earth. And in these old photos there seems to be a real sense of awe and reverence for the marvels of civil engineering.The above photo is a scene from the reversal of the Chicago River (see episode episode #86, true believers!). The reason that photo is famous\xe2\x80\x94or at least famous enough for us to have seen it\xe2\x80\x94is because the reversal of the Chicago River was an enormous engineering project that was successful.But you have to figure that there were countless other photographs depicting similarly-awe-inspiring feats of engineering prowess that we have never seen\xe2\x80\x94 because those feats turned out to be failures.Failures like the Port of Dallas., On the southwest corner of Central Park West and 106th Street in New York City, there\'s an enormous castle. It takes up the whole east end of the block, with its red brick cylindrical turrets topped with gleaming silver cones. All the stained glass windows and intricate stonework make the building looks like something out of a fairytale.This building\xe2\x80\x99s past, however, is not very fairytale-like at all.When it was built in 1887, this castle was the country\xe2\x80\x99s first hospital devoted solely to the treatment of cancer. In the late 1800s, cancer was known to start as a tumor, but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know a whole lot beyond that.In the back of the castle, was a smoke stack that used to lead out from the crematorium. That smokestack was smoking pretty often., In the beginning, there was design.Before any other human discipline, even before the dawn of mankind its self, design was a practice passed down from generation to generation of early humans. Today, everything that has been designed\xe2\x80\x93space ships, buildings, pyramids, weapons, clothing , artwork, everything\xe2\x80\x93can be traced back to a single designed object. The first designed object: the Acheulean hand axe.This episode features designer William Lidwell and UC-Berkeley anthropologist Terrence Deacon., Around 2005, a Seattle neighborhood called Ballard started to see unprecedented growth. Condominiums and apartment buildings were sprouting up all over the community which had once been mostly single family homes and small businesses. Around this time, developers offered a woman named Edith Macefield $750,000 dollars for her small house, which was appraised at around $120,000. They wanted to build a shopping mall on the block where Macefield had lived for the last 50 years.Macefield turned down the money. Developers went forward with the shopping mall anyway. The mall enveloped her house on three sides., Cities, like living things, evolve slowly over time. Buildings and structures get added and renovated and removed, and in this process, bits and pieces that get left behind. Vestiges. Just as humans have tailbones and whales have pelvic bones, cities have doors that open into a limb-breaking drop, segments of fences that anyone can walk around, and pipes that carry nothing at all.Most of the time, these architectural leftovers rust or crumble or get taken down. But other times, these vestiges aren\xe2\x80\x99t removed. They remain in the urban organism. And sometimes\xe2\x80\x94even though they no longer serve any discernible purpose\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re actually maintained. They get cleaned and polished and re-painted just because they\xe2\x80\x99re there.These urban vestiges first caught the attention of an artist in Japan named Akasegawa Genpei. One day, in 1972, he was walking to lunch, and he came across a staircase that went up and then back down but had no door at the top. Then Akasegawa noticed that a piece of the railing that had been recently fixed. That\'s when something clicked.Akasegawa started noticing similar urban leftovers, and treasured them as artistic byproducts of the city. He photographed all the things he could find that were both vestigial and maintained. He began publishing his findings in a magazine column, accompanied by musings about each object.People began to send Akasegawa pictures of similar architectural leftovers that they found, and in his column, Akasegawa would judge all submissions on two criteria:1. Were they truly, completely useless?2. Were they regularly maintained?In 1985 Akasegawa published a book of these collected photographs and writings, in which he coined a term for these kinds of urban leftovers. He called them, \xe2\x80\x9cThomassons.\xe2\x80\x9d, IKEA hacking is the practice of buying things from IKEA and reengineering\xe2\x80\x94or "hacking"\xe2\x80\x94them to become customized, more functional, and often just better designed stuff. The locus of the IKEA hacking movement is a website called IKEAhackers.net. It\xe2\x80\x99s a showcase for people who have tricked out their KALLAXES, their ARKELSTORPS and their FL\xc3\x84RDFULLS .Would-be hackers can gather tips from other hackers, and once they\'re ready, post pictures and how-to guides of their own hacks.IKEAhackers.net was started in 2006 by Jules Yap (Jules is not her real first name\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a pseudonym\xc2\xa0derived from an IKEA product). But in March of 2014, Yap got a cease and desist letter from IKEA. IKEA\xc2\xa0claimed that using their trademarked name \xc2\xa0was a violation\xe2\x80\x94even just using the blue and yellow color scheme was not allowed.Producer Sean Cole spoke with Jules Yap of IKEAhackers.net, and academics Daniela Rosner and Jonathan Bean (the latter of whom helped him hack an IKEA storage-bed out of KALLAX bookcases and some doors that can be found at any big-box home improvement store)., Way back in October 2011 (see\xc2\xa0episode #38,\xc2\xa0true believers!), we broadcast a short excerpt of a radio documentary produced by Peregrine Andrews about faking the sounds of sports on TV broadcasts. It was one of our most popular and provocative programs ever, primarily because people were shocked that any aspect of a sporting event might be faked. Since then, I\'ve received several requests from the audience asking where they can\xc2\xa0hear the full-length documentary. Well today, my friends, you are in luck.When we think of the sound of sports on TV or radio, it\'s generally commentary. But sports broadcasts would be nothing without all the sounds that are behind the commentary-- the crowds, the kicks, the thwacks, and the grunts., As humans have developed cities and built environments, we have also needed to develop ways to find our way through them. Sam Greenspan went on a wayfinding tour with Jim Harding in the Atlanta airport. Harding is one of the expert "invisibles" that do critical, but generally unrecognized work profiled in a new book by David Zweig., The best knock-offs in the world are in China. There are plenty of fake designer handbags and Rolexes, but China\'s knock-offs go way beyond fashion. There are knock-off Apple stores that look so much like the real thing, some employees believe they are working in real Apple stores. And then there are entire knock-off cities., Reporter Whitney Jones argues that R.E.M.\xe2\x80\x99s Out of Time is the most politically significant album in the history of the United States. Because of its packaging., Well before the early 1500s, when Sir Thomas Moore first coined the term "Utopia," people have been thinking about how to design their ideal community. Maybe it\'s one that doesn\'t use money, or one that drops traditional family structures and raises children collectively. For a community of people on the outskirts of the small Arizona town of Snowflake, "utopia" is just a place where they won\'t be physically sick. That\'s because everyone in this community is suffering from Multiple Chemical Sensitivity or MCS., When designing a commercial structure, there is\xc2\xa0one safety component\xc2\xa0that must be designed right into the building from the start: egress.\xe2\x80\x9cEgress\xe2\x80\x9d refers to an\xc2\xa0entire exit system from a building: stairs, corridors, and evacuation routes outside the building. Each state\xe2\x80\x99s building code specifies\xc2\xa0a certain number of means of egress, depending on the size and purpose of the structure.Simply put, there\xc2\xa0have to be enough doors, corridors, and stairs for every occupant to exit in an orderly manner in the event of an emergency., During the 1961 Berlin Crisis\xe2\x80\x94one of the various moments in the cold war in which we came frighteningly close to engaging in actual war with the Soviets\xe2\x80\x94President John F. Kennedy vowed to identify spaces in "existing structures both public and private that could be used for fallout shelters in case of attack."After JFK\'s speech, a fallout shelter economy sprung up overnight in the U.S. There were door to door bomb-shelter salesmen, shelter displays at malls and county fairs, and pamphlets for sale on every magazine rack.But by the time Kennedy made that speech, one small town in Southern New Mexico had already broken ground on a unique shelter that would double as an elementary school., The term "hijacking" goes back to prohibition days, when gangsters would rob moonshine trucks saying, "Hold your hands high, Jack!" However, in the early days of commercial air travel, the idea that someone would hijack a plane was scarcely even considered.When the government started to oversee aviation in 1958, the congressional law did not even make hijacking a crime and the early design of airport terminals reflected this mentality. Airports were once more like train stations, where you walk through the terminal and onto the tarmac, and sometimes straight onto the plane itself, without flashing a ticket or showing anyone your identification.Then in 1961, an epidemic of hijackings began.For this story, Roman spoke with Brendan Koerner, author of The Skies Belong to Us: Love and Terror in the Golden Age of Hijacking., As a fashion object and symbol, the high heel shoe is weighted with meaning. It\xe2\x80\x99s also weighted with the wearer\xe2\x80\x99s entire body weight. The stiletto might be one of the only designs that is physically painful but has somehow has persisted for centuries.At their origins, high heeled shoes were originally worn by men. As early as the tenth century, many horseback riding cultures wore heels on their boots and on their shoes, because heels help you stay in the stirrups (which is why cowboy boots have heels)., 99% Invisible presents Song Exploder.\xc2\xa0A song is a product of design. It\'s difficult to create an original melody, but that\'s only the blueprint. Every element of a piece of music could be produced any number of ways, depending on which instrument plays at what time, for how long, and with what what kind of effect. The architecture behind a piece of music can be much more involved than meets the ear, and this is what inspired Hrishikesh Hirway to start a podcast called Song Exploder, where musicians "take apart their songs, and piece by piece, tell the story of how they were made.", In just about every movie set in New York City in the 1970s and 80s there\'s an establishing shot with a graffiti-covered subway.For city officials, train graffiti was a sign that they had lost control. So, starting in the early 70s, mayors of New York vowed to eradicate graffiti. First, Mayor John Lindsey formed the first anti-graffiti task force. He also re-classified graffiti from a nuisance, like littering or loitering, into a crime.In 1984 David Gunn became President of the New York City Transit Authority.Systemically, train line by train line, Gunn took the subways off the map for graffiti writers. While they were fixing it, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t allow any graffiti on it. If graffiti artists \xe2\x80\x9cbombed\xe2\x80\x9d a train car, the MTA pulled it from the system. Even during rush hour.May 12, 1989 was declared the official day of the city\'s victory over train graffiti.But of course train graffiti has never stopped.There is still subway graffiti\xe2\x80\x94it just never leaves the train yards. Artists\xe2\x80\x94many of them from abroad\xe2\x80\x94paint subway cars knowing full well that they will get cleaned before they\'re ever seen by the public., When I go into a bank, especially if I have to stand in line waiting to make a deposit, my mind wanders. And one of the first place it wanders to is: how I would rob the place. How could it be done? Most of the time, buildings are our friends. But it\'s fun to recast the building as the enemy. The obstacle we have to overcome., The westernmost part of Manhattan, between 34th and 39th street, is pretty industrial. There\xe2\x80\x99s a bus depot, a ferry terminal, and a steady stream of cars. But in the late 19th early 20th centuries, this was cow country.Cows used to be ferried across the Hudson River from New Jersey, herded across Twelfth Avenue (now the West Side Highway), and brought to this part of town to be made into beef.You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of the meat packing district. This was like the meat hacking district. It was nicknamed "Abattoir Place." It was a hive of bone boilers and hide stretchers and lard renderers. There was a disassembly line for every single part of a cow.As more and more cows were ferried to the slaughterhouses in Manhattan, it became impossible for passing herds to to coexist with Twelfth Avenue traffic. Not only did the number of cows increase, but so too had the number of carriages, and trains, and, eventually, cars. Cows were in the way. There were reports of epic cow jams on Twelfth avenue.That\xe2\x80\x99s why people invented cow tunnels. Or at least the story of cow tunnels. At one point there might have actually been tunnels made expressly for cows to march underneath Twelfth Avenue to the abattoir. Or people might have just invented this crazy story about cow tunnels because everybody loves a good, vaguely plausible urban myth.We have tunnels for cars, for subways, electrical cables, and the internet. Could there be subterranean infrastructure for cows, too?, In 1990, the federal government invited a group of geologists, linguists, astrophysicists, architects, artists, and writers to the New Mexico desert, to visit the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. They were there on a mission.The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) is the nation\'s only permanent underground repository for nuclear waste. Eventually, WIPP will be sealed up and left alone. Years will pass and those years will become decades. Those decades will become centuries and those centuries will roll into millennia. People above ground will come and go. Cultures will rise and fall. And all the while, below the surface, that cave full of waste will get smaller and smaller, until the salt caverns swallow up all those oil drums and entombs them. Then, all the old radioactive gloves and tools and little bits from bombs \xe2\x80\x93all still radioactive\xe2\x80\x93 will be solidified in the earth\'s crust for more than 200,000 years. Basically forever.The problem that the aforementioned panel was convened to address was how to convey this information to people 10,000 years in the future, when language and symbols may be so different as to make direct communication impossible., About ten miles north of Concord, New Hampshire, off of interstate 93 there\xe2\x80\x99s a little island with a great, big monument on it. The monument depicts a woman, who is holding a hatchet in her right hand and bunch of scalps in her left hand. When it was erected in 1874, this was the first statue\xc2\xa0to honor a woman in the United States. But despite this historic status, the monument is controversial because of the woman it memorializes and what she did. The woman in the monument is Hannah Duston and in 1697 she was living in Haverhill, Massachusetts when she, her infant daughter and her nurse-maid, Mary Neff were kidnapped by a band of Abenaki Native Americans. The three were marched north and at some point Hannah\xe2\x80\x99s infant daughter was killed by the Abenakis. They stopped for the night in Boscawen, New Hampshire (on the island above with the monument) and while the Abenaki families slept, Hannah and her companions killed ten of them \xe2\x80\x93 including six children \xe2\x80\x93 and then scalped each victim before making their escape back to Haverhill., If you\'ve wandered around Machu Picchu, or Stonehenge, or the Colosseum, or even snuck into that abandoned house on the edge of town, you know the power in a piece of decrepit architecture. And even if you don\'t want to leave your house, the internet is littered with evidence of the human love affair with all things abandoned.People flock to remainders of ancient civilizations, but people also flock to things that just look like they\xe2\x80\x99re ancient. The combination of decomposition and romance makes a perfect cocktail of repulsion and allure. And for San Franciscans, this place is Sutro Baths.At the northwestern edge of San Francisco, right on the Pacific Ocean, is a curious jumble of concrete ruins. You wouldn\'t know just looking at it, but this ruin is quite young. It\'s what\'s left of Sutro Baths, a palatial indoor swimming pool and amusement park built in 1898., Uniforms matter. When it comes to sports, they might be the only thing to which we\'re actually loyal.Sports uniforms are packaging. But unlike any other packaging, if the product inside changes or degrades, we remain loyal. Players come and go, but change the uniform, and you\'ll hear about it.There are very few ways for players to put their own personal style into their uniforms. In baseball, in the face of huge opposition from curved-brim loyalists, some players take the bold stance of wearing a straight brim, like George Sherrill who is nick-named "The Brim Reaper" for his flat-brimmed style.But for people who really geek out about baseball uniforms (like Paul Lukas from Uni Watch) the space below the knee may be the most interesting. It is here that players have the most choices, can make the biggest statement, and be, in the words of Lukas, masters of the "uni-verse."Most players today choose to wear their pants long, but if you truly want to honor baseball\'s hosiery heritage, you should wear your pants up over your calves and a sharp pair of stirrups.Paul Lukas of Uni Watch (and creator of the zine Beer Frame, to which 99% Invisible owes a considerable debt) talked with Jesse Thorn, host of the NPR show Bullseye, owner of Maximumfun.org, and life-long SF Giants fans, even though it\'s really hard to wear the cap out because black and orange doesn\'t go with anything., When it was built in 1977, Citicorp Center (later renamed Citigroup Center, now called 601 Lexington) was, at 59 stories, the seventh-tallest building in the world. You can pick it out of the New York City skyline by its 45-degree angled top.But it\'s the base of the building that really makes the tower so unique. The bottom nine of its 59 stories are stilts.This thing does not look sturdy. But it has to be sturdy. Otherwise they wouldn\'t have built it this way.Right?The architect of Citicorp Center was Hugh Stubbins, but most of the credit for this building is given to its chief structural engineer, William LeMessurier.According to LeMessurier, in 1978 he got a phone call from an undergraduate architecture student making a bold claim about LeMessurier\'s building. He told LeMessurier that Citicorp Center could blow over in the wind., The name is important. It\xe2\x80\x99s the first thing of any product you use or buy or see. The tip of the spear. You are bombarded by thousands of names every day.In this daily barrage, only the names that are most interesting and most pleasant on the tongue can survive in your memory. So it\'s no surprise that companies\xe2\x80\x94especially large ones like Sony or Procter &amp; Gamble\xe2\x80\x94hire naming companies.That is, there are companies that come up with names for things. Cars, lines of yogurt, iPhone apps, small businesses, sodas, movies, and even theories have all been named by professionals.There are really only a handful of businesses that deal exclusively in names, and their services can cost thens of thousands of dollars. In addition to coming up with names, they also determine what names are available for trademark, which URLs are available, and they conduct linguistic checks to ensure that potential names are pronounceable, unique, and appropriate in languages around the world., When George Laurer goes to the grocery store, he doesn\'t tell the check-out people that he invented the barcode, but his wife used to point it out. "My husband here\'s the one who invented that barcode," she\'d occasionally say. And the check-out people would look at him like, "you mean there was a time when we didn\'t have barcodes?" A time without barcodes is hard to imagine now. But it wasn\'t that long ago, and the story doesn\'t start with George Laurer. It starts with an engineer named Joseph Woodland., When it\'s three o\'clock in the morning and everything is going wrong in your life, there\'s a certain kind of ad you might see on basic cable. Lawyers\xe2\x80\x93usually guys\xe2\x80\x93promise to battle the heartless, tight-wad insurance companies on your behalf. There\'s disaster footage and stiff readings off of cue cards. The ads look like they were made in a high school A.V. class.Believe it or not, lawyer ads are actually tightly regulated. There was an era before ads like these were allowed\xe2\x80\x93and a big bang after which they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be contained. And now, the legal world is in a subtle, possibly endless civil war over how attorneys should advertise their services (and whether they should advertise at all).This story was produced by contributor Sean "The Hammer" Cole. Sean spoke with On the Media host (and former Advertising Age critic) Bob Garfield; Elizabeth Tarbert, who is on the ethics council for the Florida Bar; divorce attorney Steve Miler; Lucien Pera, an attorney who advises nationwide law firms on their ads; personal injury attorneys Matt Hardin and Lowell "The Hammer" Stanley., Quatrefoil is the name of the four-lobed cloverleaf shape. It\'s everywhere: adorning Gothic cathedrals, more modern churches, Rhode Island mansions, mission-style roofs in California, and decorating victorian homes from coast to coast. It\'s embroidered on bedding, plastered on wallpaper, and patterned on public garbage cans.The quatrefoil has been re-interpreted and re-contextualized in a phenomenon called "iconographical drift.\xe2\x80\x9d The associations with the shape are constantly shifting depending on where it\xe2\x80\x99s used, who is using it, and the purpose for which it is used.But no matter where it\xe2\x80\x99s turns up, it always implies the same thing: fanciness., A few years ago, reporter Sean Cole was working on a radio story and needed to interview the\xc2\xa0rapper Busta Rhymes.Sean was living in Boston at the time, so he did a Google search for\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cBusta Rhymes\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cBoston\xe2\x80\x9d to see if Busta had any upcoming shows that Sean could stake out.Google didn\xe2\x80\x99t return any relevant tour dates. But it did give Sean a map, centering on a tiny speck of land in a neighboring suburb called Shrewsbury, Massachusetts.The tiny speck of land was labeled Busta Rhymes Island., At its peak, the Berlin Wall was 100 miles long. Today only about a mile is left standing.Compared with other famous walls in history, this wall had a pretty short life span.The Great Wall of China has been around for 2500 years. So have the walls of ancient Babylon\xe2\x80\x94although its most famous part, the Ishtar Gate, is actually in a museum in Berlin.But even though the wall dividing Berlin into East and West was only up for 30 years, it had a huge impact on the psyche of the city. It broke families in two. In the decade that followed, more than 2 million people fled from east to west. East Germany was losing its most skilled workers as they sought jobs--and to reunite with their families--across the border. And East Germany was losing face with every East Berliner who chose to defect.And that\xe2\x80\x99s why, in 1961, East Germany closed its border to West Berlin with a wall. But this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a story about the design of the Berlin Wall. This is a story about one design to get through it\xe2\x80\x94or really, underneath it. Ralph Kabisch, then a 20-something-year-old university student, was there., It started with some Pittsburgh humor.Pittsburgh-based comedian Tom Muisal does a bit about a GPS unit that can give directions in "Pittsburghese." Because in Pittsburgh, no one calls it "Interstate 376," it\'s "The Parkway." It\'s not "The Liberty Tunnel," it\'s "The Liberty Tubes."And directions are often given by way of what used to be there.One day Tom was trying this routine out on his friend, Mike Neilson. Mike is not from Pittsburgh--he grew up on the other side of the state. When he moved to the Steel City, he had a hard time figuring out how to get around. Because Pittsburghers are always telling him to turn left at something that isn\'t there anymore.And then, as Mike was listening to Tom\'s Pittsburgher GPS routine, he noticed that in in one iteration of the joke he said, "turn left at the place that used to be a Pizza Hut."This resonated with Mike. He realized that, because the architecture of a Pizza Hut is so distinctive, he could easily identify any building that used to be a Pizza Hut. The former Pizza Hut was thus a beacon of light shining through a thick fog of impossible directions. Here, in his friend\'s comedy routine, was the one Pittsburghese direction he could give that anyone, regardless of where they\'re from, could comprehend: turn left at the place that used to be a Pizza Hut.And from there, Mike created a global atlas of all the places that used to be Pizza Huts., There is a beauty to a universal standard. The idea that people across the world can agree that when they interact with one specific thing, everyone will be on the same page-- regardless of language or culture or geographic locale. If you\'re in Belgrade or Shanghai or S\xc3\xa3o Paulo, you can look at a sign and know instantly, without speaking a word of the local language, that this floor is slippery. That the emergency exit is over there. That that substance is poisonous, and you should not eat it.The group behind those internationally recognized logos is called the International Organization for Standardization. One of the most recognizable ISO symbols in the International Symbol of Access. You might not know it by that name, but you\'ve seen it.The International Symbol of Access is everywhere--on parking spaces, on buttons that operate automatic doors, in bathrooms, on seats on the bus or at movie theaters. Anywhere there\xe2\x80\x99s an indication of special accommodations made for people with disabilities.The logo was created through a design contest in 1968, coordinated by an organization now called Rehabilitation International. The logo would have to be readily identifiable from reasonable distance, self-descriptive, simple, unambiguous, and practical. The winner was a Danish designer named Susanne Koefed--though her original design didn\'t have a head!As the logo got absorbed into the built environment, and the politics of (dis)ability became more nuanced, some people started finding it a little lacking. So one group, the Accessible Icon Project, has created a new logo that they hope will ultimately replace ISO standard., You know the saying: you can\xe2\x80\x99t judge a book by its cover. With magazines, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty much the opposite. The cover of a magazine is the unified identity for a whole host of ideas, authors, and designers who have created the eclectic array of stories and articles and materials within each issue. And, some would argue, this identity extends to the reader as well.So if, say, you\'re seen with an issue of Vogue, you\'re don\'t just own that copy--you become a Vogue reader.Magazine covers are a challenge to design, since they have to be both ever-changing and also consistently recognizable. For this reason, most publications stick to a standard set practices., Like the best of these stories, the two bitter rivals started out as best friends: William Van Alen and Craig Severance.They were business partners. Van Alen was considered the artistic maverick and Severance was the savvy businessman. It\'s unclear why they broke up, but at some point, Severance decided he could do better on his own. The two parted ways and set up separate practices.At the time of their breakup, New York City was undergoing a boom like nothing ever seen before. Massive wealth turned Manhattan into some of the most valuable property in human history. And when property gets valuable, we build up.Late in 1928 Walter Chrysler, founder of the Chrysler car company, came to New York and bought a plot of land and decided to build, what he referred to as, "a monument to me." Van Alen had already been working on plans for the previous owner of that plot and Chrysler decided to hire him to develop that plan into what would become the Chrysler Building. Walter Chrysler was a great fan of art and architecture and felt a real kinship with the Beaux-Arts trained William Van Alen.Meanwhile, downtown at 40 Wall Street, Craig Severance was planning the Manhattan Company Building. It was funded primarily by the young, Wall Street hot shot, George Ohrstrom. The two towers had different goals. Severance\'s building was being constructed to make money. The Chrysler Building was intended to be a monument to Chrysler, but it also aimed to be a beautiful and innovative structure.At the time, Cass Gilbert\'s Woolworth building was the tallest building in New York City and both Van Alen and Severance intended to take its crown.What followed was an epic back and forth struggle for the glory of ruling the New York City skyline., On July 28, 1945, an airplane crashed into the Empire State Building. A B-25 bomber was flying a routine mission, chartering servicemen from Massachusetts to New York City.Capt. William F. Smith, who had led some of the most dangerous missions in World War II in the European theatre, was the pilot. The day was foggy. Smith called LaGuardia Airport and requested a clearance to land. With nearly zero visibility, the tower suggested that Smith stay in the air. He ignored air traffic control and started a descent that took him over midtown Manhattan.Just as he straightened out, the clouds broke up enough for him to realize he was flying among skyscrapers.The bomber crashed into the Empire State Building, the tallest building in the world at the time. The collision killed Smith, two others on the plane, and eleven people who worked inside the building.When the plane hit, parts of the engine flew ahead and severed the lifting cables of two elevators on the 79th floor. The elevators crashed to the sub-basement. In one of the elevators was a 19-year-old elevator operator named Betty Lou Oliver. She broke her pelvis, back and neck \xe2\x80\x94 but she survived.This story was produced by Joe Richman and Samara Freemark for Radio Diaries. The Radio Diaries podcast is produced by Sarah Kramer., Elevators are old. They would have to be. Because it is in our nature to rise.History is full of things that lift other things. In ancient Greece, and China, and Hungary, there were systems of weights and pulleys and platforms designed to bring nobility--or their meals--to new heights.And somewhere below were draft animals, or even people, tasked with turning a wheel to bring these early elevators up and down. One man even spent the year of 1743 in a chimney in order to turn a lever to raise King Louis XV on a platform so the king wouldn\'t have to walk up a single flight of stairs.These elevators were dangerous. Ropes would snap, and then anything getting raised or lowered would plummet to the ground. Fall one story and you break your leg--fall two stories you break your neck. And this fear of falling kept building heights low. People only wanted to ascend as high as they could walk. The tallest buildings for most of the 19th century were churches, or lighthouses--buildings made up primarily of empty space.And then came Elisha Otis.Nate Dimeo from the memory palace provides our stories today. It\'s a fantastic monthly program everyone should subscribe to., If you tune around on a shortwave radio, you might stumble across a voice reciting an endless stream of numbers. Just numbers, all day, everyday. These so-called "numbers stations," say nothing about where they are transmitting from or who they are trying to reach, but they can be heard in Spanish, Thai, German, Russian, Chinese, and any number of other languages from around the world.These mysterious shortwave transmissions caught the attention of producer David Goren when he was just a kid. His piece, Atencion! Seis Siete Tres Siete Cero: The Mystery of the Shortwave Numbers Stations, aired in 2000 as part of the series Lost and Found Sound. In tuning into these weird little broadcasts, Goren joins a curious community that has been listening to numbers stations for decades, some suspecting that the stations are run by intelligence agencies sending encrypted messages to individual agents in the field., Cameron Smith is building a space suit in his apartment.He\'s not an astronaut. He\'s not even an engineer. Cameron Smith is an archaeologist--on faculty in the anthropology department at Portland State University in Oregon. But Cameron is an explorer by nature. He\xe2\x80\x99s been diving in Puget Sound, survived arctic winters in Iceland and Alaska and summited Oregon\xe2\x80\x99s Mount Hood more times than he can count.Now he wants to take on outer space. And since Cameron doesn\'t have an entire space program behind him, that means doing it on the cheap. His homemade space suite costs $2,000. A standard issue suit from NASA runs about $12 million.The space suit has been a 3 years in the making. Eventually, Cameron will put on the suit and step into a gondola and a balloon (also homemade) will take him up 50,000 feet in the air. At that point, he\'ll be depending on his own craftiness to keep himself alive.This episode is based off an episode of the public radio program and podcast, Destination DIY., We have seen the future, and the future is mostly blue.Or, put another way: in our representations of the future in science fiction movies, blue seems to be the dominant color of our interfaces with technology yet to come. And that is one of the many design lessons we can learn from sci-fi.Designers and sci-fi aficionados Chris Noessel and Nathan Shedroff have spent years compiling real-world lessons that designers can, should, and already do take from science fiction. Their new book, Make It So: Interaction Design Lessons From Science Fiction is a comprehensive compendium of their findings.All music (after pledge preamble) is by OK Ikumi., There is an allure in unbuilt structures: the utopian, futuristic transports, the impossibly tall skyscrapers, even the horrible highways, all capture our imagination with what could have been. Whether these never built structures are perceived as good or bad, they still had an effect on the environment that does exist. We talk with Allison Arieff, John King and Andrew Lynch about the amazing things we missed out on, and the bullets we dodged, in the history of the unbuilt in San Francisco and New York City.Season 4 Kickstarter:www.kickstarter.com/projects/174830\xe2\x80\xa6season-4-weekly, The story goes like this: Theophilus Van Kannel hated chivalry. There was nothing he despised more than trying to walk in or out of a building, and locking horns with other men in a game of "oh you first, I insist." But most of all, Theophilus Van Kannel hated opening doors for women.He set about inventing his way out of social phobia. And that\'s how, 1888, Theophilus Van Kannel was awarded US Patent\xc2\xa0#387571\xc2\xa0A for a "Storm-door structure," which would soon become known as the revolving door.**Be one of the 10,000!

Join us!In this mini-episode, we revisit John Marr\'s story that started a tiny 99% Invisible movement: "Always Read the Plaque.", 99% Invisible started as a side project I made in my bedroom at night, and after two years of making the program, I turned to Kickstarter to see if I should keep it going. To my great surprise, the Season 3 fund-raising campaign broke all previous records for a journalism project on Kickstarter. We hired a producer (Sam Greenspan!), overhauled the website, grew the audience, and made the show better than it has ever been.For Season 4, we want to Kickstart the next giant leap in the evolution of 99% Invisible:We want to go weekly.We\'re staffing up and going pro. This involves hiring more help (contract reporters, editors, a production coordinator, paid interns), moving into a proper office, and commissioning more stories. The 52 weekly episodes of Season 4 will start February 4, 2014 and run for one year.Please pledge now:http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1748303376/99-invisible-season-4-weekly, We have one cardinal rule on 99% Invisible: No cardinals. Meaning, we deal with the built world, not the natural world.So, when I read Jon Mooallem\xe2\x80\x99s brilliant book, Wild Ones: A Sometimes Dismaying, Weirdly Reassuring Story About Looking at People Looking at Animals in America, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think we\'d ever do an episode of 99% Invisible about it. I just read it for fun.But then I saw Jon perform stories from the book live with musical accompaniment from the band Black Prairie. And that changed everything.What you need to know about Wild Ones is that it\'s not a book about nature. It\xe2\x80\x99s a book about how we fit nature into our lives. Wild Ones is about the cutesy stuffed animals, the eco-tours, and the byzantine methods of conservation that evolve when our experience with wild life goes from something natural to something designed. Human-animal interaction has become a designed experience and the story of that transition, as the title of the book suggests, is sometimes dismaying and weirdly reassuring., If you are an undertaker in 1878 Kansas City, and you learn that your competitor\'s wife works as a telephone switchboard operator and has been diverting business calls meant for you to her husband, you have a few potential courses of action. Almon Brown Stroger picked the one that changed the world.Last July, we told the story of the Purple Hotel. Here\'s the original story, with an update at the end.--What\xe2\x80\x99s the difference between what the public sees and what an architect sees when they look at a building?The hotel on the very prominent corner of Touhy and Kilbourn Avenues in Lincolnwood, Illinois used to be the town\xe2\x80\x99s most famous building: The first Hyatt hotel in all of Chicagoland, premiere accommodations, top-notch restaurant. It was swank! Roberta Flack stayed there. Barry Mannilow stayed there. Perry Como. Michael Jordon stayed there on his first night in Chicago. Every thirteen-year-old in the area had their bar mitzvah there.Then, slowly, over time, it became Lincolnwood\xe2\x80\x99s most infamous building. Changed hands, got seedy and run down. It was the home of the Midwest Fetish Fair and Marketplace convention. There were drug-fueled sex parties attended by shady Chicago politicians later convicted of things like extortion. And of course there was the convicted mobster Alan Dorfman, who was gunned down in the parking lot. It\xe2\x80\x99s now dilapidated and empty.But even if you know nothing about the history, everyone in the area knows this hotel.Because it\xe2\x80\x99s purple. Really, really purple., If you were a movie star in the market for a mansion in 1930s Los Angeles, there was a good chance you might call on Wallace Neff.Neff wasn\'t just an architect--he was a starchitect. One of his most famous projects was the renovation of Pickfair, the estate owned by the iconic silent film actress Mary Pickford, and her husband Douglas Fairbanks. When the couple moved into Pickfar, the house sat on a nameless street in an empty neighborhood called Beverly Hills. If you were lucky enough to be invited to dinner at Pickfair you might find yourself seated next to Babe Ruth, the King of Spain or Albert Einstein. Life magazine called Pickfair \xe2\x80\x9conly slightly less important than the white house, and much more fun.\xe2\x80\x9d Neff designed estates for Charlie Chaplin, Judy Garland and Groucho Marx. His Libby Ranch is now owned by Reese Witherspoon.But at the end of his life, Wallace Neff lived in a 1,000 square foot concrete bubble. And Neff believed that this simple dome was his greatest architectural achievements.Los Angeles-based reporter David Weinberg spoke with historian Jeffrey Head, author of No Nails, No Lumber: The Bubble Houses of Wallace Neff. David also spoke with Kathy Miles, who grew up in Igloo Village; Steve Roden, an artist and current resident of the last remaining bubble house in the US; and architect Stefanos Polyzoides, who has his practice in a classic Spanish/Mediterranean-style Wallace Neff building.We also hear from Dakar-based producer Juliana Friend, who was nice enough to go check on the bubbles over there.A different version of this story originally aired on KCRW as part of their Independent Producer Project.David Weinberg is also the brains behind Random Tape, an audio experiment in, well, random tape., There\xe2\x80\x99s a term that epitomizes what we radio producers aspire to create: the \xe2\x80\x9cdriveway moment.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s when a story is so good that you literally can\xe2\x80\x99t get out of your car. Inside of a driveway moment, time becomes elastic--you could be staring straight at a clock for the entire duration of the story, but for that length of time, the clock has no power over you.But ironically, inside the machinery of public radio--the industry that creates driveway moments--the clock rules all.Reporter/producer Julia Barton explores the design of the broadcast clock, the pie diagram that determines what you listen to when., By now, the story is well known. A man sits in the backseat of a cab, sketching on a notepad as night falls over a crumbling city. He scribbles the letter I. He draws a heart. And then an N, and then a Y. Right away he knows he\'s got something. This is it, he thinks. This is the campaign.The man was a designer named Milton Glaser. The City was New York. The year was 1977.The city needed a miracle. And it kind of got one in three letters and a symbol: I \xe2\x99\xa5 NYThe I \xe2\x99\xa5 NY campaign was so successful that it became part of the built environment. So people started doing with I \xe2\x99\xa5 NY the same thing that humans have always done when encountering something in nature: they started imitating it., Chicago\'s biggest design achievement probably isn\xe2\x80\x99t one of its amazing skyscrapers, but the Chicago River, a waterway disguised as a remnant of the natural landscape. But it isn\'t natural, not really. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to tell when you see the river, but it\xe2\x80\x99s going the wrong way. It should flow into Lake Michigan, but instead fresh water from Lake Michigan flows backwards, into the city. The Chicago River is, in large part, a carefully-designed extension of the city\xe2\x80\x99s sewer system.Reporter Dan Weissmann talked with Richard Cahan (author of "The Lost Panoramas: When Chicago Changed its River and the Land Beyond") about the amazing lengths the city went to, over the course of several decades, to carry away the sewage that threatened to drown Chicago., If you grew up watching Warner Brothers cartoons, you might remember seeing the name Chuck Jones in big letters in the opening credits. Chuck Jones directed cartoons like Looney Tunes from the 1930s until his death in 2002. He was also an animator, and brought the world characters like Elmer Fudd.But part of what makes his characters so memorable is the world that they inhabit. Part of what\xe2\x80\x99s so striking about Looney Tunes is that they are recognizable as Looney Tunes even without characters in the foreground.The backgrounds were revolutionized one layout artist: Maurice Noble., An ode to an information designer who made life a little bit easier for millions and millions of people: Ladislav Sutnar, the man who put parentheses around area codes.Plus99% Invisible and Planet Money team up and we talk to commodities traders to answer one of the most important questions in finance: What actually happens at the end of Trading Places?We know something crazy happens on the trading floor. We know that Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd get rich and the Duke brothers lose everything. But how does it all happen? And could it happen in the real world?, Growing up in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Alex Goldman was a misfit. Bored and disaffected and angry, he longed for a place to escape to. And then he found Heyoon.The only way to find out about Heyoon for someone to take you there. It was like there was this secret club of kids who knew about it. Alex got initiated when he was fifteen.To find Heyoon, you\'d drive out into the middle of nowhere, deep in the country, and park alongside a dirt road. A fence ran along the property line, with signage explicitly telling passers by to keep out. Once over the fence, a path behind a white farmhouse led to a thin line of trees, and then to a huge field. And there was something else there in the field. Something man-made. Something really big., I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to concede from the get-go that I might be wrong about the entire premise of this story, but Superman has never really worked for me as a character. I preferred the more grounded Marvel Comic book characters, like Spider-man, who lived in real cities and had human thoughts and feelings. Superman is basically invincible, not relatable, and oozed \xe2\x80\x9cestablishment.\xe2\x80\x9d And even though I really love the first Christopher Reeve Superman movie, it contains a perfect example of why I don\xe2\x80\x99t really dig the character. Just so you know, this is a 25 year-old\xc2\xa0spoiler alert, but at end of the 1978 movie, all of the greatness of that film is nearly undone by the fundamental flaw in having a character that is all-powerful. Superman flies around the earth backwards and turns back time!My problems with the character aside, Superman is an extremely successful and important design.\xc2\xa0Glen Weldon, author of\xc2\xa0Superman: The Unauthorized Biography\xc2\xa0(and panelist of the great\xc2\xa0Pop Culture Happy Hour) talks me through the iconography of our first superhero and why Supes has managed to stay relevant for 75 years. Glen even explains why I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong about Superman \xe2\x80\x9cturning back time\xe2\x80\x9d in the 1978 Superman movie., There\xe2\x80\x99s something about rebar that fascinates me. If nothing else because there are very few things that invoke a fear of being skewered.My preoccupation with metal reinforcement bars dovetails nicely with a structure in San Francisco I\xe2\x80\x99ve kind of become obsessed with-- a tiny bridge on the eastern edge of Golden Gate Park called the Alvord Lake Bridge.Ernest Ransome, the father of modern rebar, constructed the bridge in 1889. Today, it is a dumpy, cracked and neglected structure. The inside is a surreal tunnel of phony stalactites.But the Alvord Lake Bridge is, quite literally, the bridge to the modern world. It is one the oldest reinforced concrete structures still standing. The twisted iron bars embedded in the bridge served as the model for the all the rebar containing structures that followed. It is the ancestor to an endless number of reinforced concrete buildings, bridges, tunnels, viaducts, and foundations. Ransome major innovation in rebar was to twist the square bar so that it bonded to the concrete better.Concrete has incredible compression strength, but it does not have much tensile strength. So if you want concrete to span any significant distance, you need to embed metal reinforcement.Thanks to CCA Senior Adjunct Professor of Architecture, William Littman (he of the Forgotten Monument) for first telling me about the Alvord Lake Bridge and showing me around. I spoke with Robert Courland, author of Concrete Planet: The Strange and Fascinating Story of the World\xe2\x80\x99s Most Common Man-Made Material (a great book!) and Bob Risser of the Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute (a great person to talk to!)., Lawyers have an ethics code. Journalists have an ethics code. Architects do, too. According to Ethical Standard 1.4 of the American Institute of Architects (AIA):"Members should uphold human rights in all their professional endeavors."A group called Architects, Designers, and Planners for Social Responsibility (ADPSR) has taken the stance that there are some buildings that just should not have been built. Buildings that, by design, violate standards of human rights.Specifically, this refers to prisons with execution chambers, or prisons that are designed keep people in long-term isolation (or as prison officials call it, "segregation"). The latter kind of prison is called a "supermax," or "security housing unit" (SHU). There is no legal definition for solitary confinement, so it\'s up for debate as to whether the SHU constitutes solitary confinement.There has been a lot of controversy surrounding one SHU at a Northern California prison called Pelican Bay.Life inside of the SHU at Pelican Bay means 22 to 23 hours a day inside of 7.5 by 12 foot room. It\'s not a space that\'s designed to keep you comfortable. But it\'s not just these architectural features, that concern humanitarian activists and psychiatrists. It\'s the amount of time many prisoners spend in that cells, alone, without any meaningful activity. Some psychiatrists, such as Terry Kupers, say there is a whole litany of effects that a SHU can have on a person: massive anxiety, paranoia, depression, concentration and memory problems, and loss of ability to control one\'s anger (which can get a prisoner in trouble and lengthen the SHU sentence). In California, SHU inmates are 33 times more likely to commit suicide than other prisoners incarcerated elsewhere in the state. There are even reports of eye damage due to the restriction on distance viewing. Terry Kupers says that a SHU "destroys people as human beings."Compared with some other prisons in the California system, the Pelican Bay SHU has some redeeming architectural features. Inmates can get natural light from skylights outside of their cells, which drifts in through doors made of a perforated metal. These porous doors also allow for inmates to communicate with each other, even though there are no lines of sight to any prisoner from within the cell.But on the other hand, cells don\'t have windows. Inmates never get to see the horizon. The only times prisoners get to leave the cell is to visit the shower, or the exercise yard--which is an empty, windowless room not that much bigger than a cell, with twenty-foot high concrete walls.Again, there is no universally accepted definition of solitary confinement. But some groups, like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have gone beyond calling the SHU solitary confinement--they call it torture. In 2011, the UN Special Rapporteur on torture said anything over 15 days in solitary confinement is a human rights abuse--which other sources have interpreted as torture.So if it is the ethical code of architects to promote human rights...what is their responsibility to the people who are incarcerated in their buildings?Enter Raphael Sperry, a San Francisco-based architect and president of ADPSR. He believes it\'s up to architects to lead the charge against these buildings. Sperry and the ADPSR are trying to get the American Institute of Architects to adopt an amendment to their ethics code:"Members shall not design spaces intended for execution or for torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, including prolonged solitary confinement."This episode is a special collaboration between 99% Invisible and the podcast Life of the Law. Find out about their show at lifeofthelaw.com, For the ancient Greeks, sirens were mythical creatures who sang out to passing sailors from rocks in the sea. Their music was so beautiful, it was said, that the sailors were powerless against it--they would turn their ships towards these sea nymphs and crash in the impassable reefs around them.In Homer\'s Odyssey, there\'s a story where Odysseus and his men are traveling near an area that Sirens are known to inhabit. Odysseus knows that if he hears the siren\'s song, his ship is going to sink. But he still wants to hear what they sound like. So he comes up with a plan: Odysseus has his men tie him to the mast of his ship so that he can\'t give commands. And then Odysseus has his men fill their own ears with beeswax so they can\'t hear anything. They set sail in striking distance of the sirens\' call. The plan works: Odysseus gets to hear the music, his men don\'t, and they sail on to safety--with Odysseus pleading with his crew to crash the boat the whole way.And for the next 2000 or so years, that\'s what a siren was: a creature that makes a beautiful sound.But that all changed in 1819, when a French engineer named Charles Cagniard de la Tour decided to call the artificial noisemaker he was working on--the siren.And this new, mechanical siren became one of THE signature sounds of the turn of the Century. Sirens warned people about immanent bombing raids during World War I. Sirens announced incoming fire engines, and ambulances, and police.Thanks in part to the siren, the world of the the early 20th Century had become a lot louder than any time in human history. And we can probably assume that these sirens that people heard in cities all over the world--sounded NOTHING like the siren songs of Greek myth.At least to most. One man, a composer, named Arseny Avraamov heard music in the cacophony of the modern world. And he tried to create a composition--a symphony-- from the clatter of the newly formed Soviet Union.Moscow-based producer Charles Maynes investigated the legend of Avraamov and his forgotten masterpiece. This is The Symphony of Sirens, Revisited.This story was part of the Global Story Project, presented by PRX with support from the Open Society Foundations.Plus, we hear a rebroadcast of "The Unsung Icons of Soviet Design." (episode #25), Americans have always had an uneasy relationship with gambling. To circumvent anti-gambling laws in the US, early slot machines masqueraded as vending machines. They gave out chewing gum as prizes, and those prizes could be redeemed for cash.That\'s where the fruit logos come from. In fact, in the UK, slot machines are called "fruit machines."Despite outward appearances, slot machines have evolved dramatically since they first appeared in 1895.To play the first slot machines, you slipped in a coin and pulled the lever to set the machine\'s wheels in motion. The slot machine\'s crank-action operation (and the way it took your money) earned it the nickname of the "one-armed bandit."But today, those hand-crank levers are uncommon, and where they do exist they are known as "legacy levers," because they have zero relation to how the machine actually works. Everything inside a slot machine has been computerized and automated--from how you enter money, to how you bet, to how you play, to how you win and lose, and even to how you feel when leave.At first, gambling machines existed at the fringes of casino culture--both figuratively and literally. The real money was in tabletop games--or so it was thought--and the slots were set up around the edges of the casino to give gamblers\' wives something to do while they waited.But then video technology expanded what slots could do. Now a machine could have more rows and columns than the standard three-by-three, and allowed you to place multiple bets on a single spin. A penny slot machine could let you place a hundred different one-cent bets per spin--so even if you win 40 cents on one line, and the machine congratulates you with flashing lights and chimes, you still lose 60 cents.And that\'s how video slots have become the most lucrative--and addictive--game in a casino.Our guest this week is Natasha Dow Sch\xc3\xbcll, an MIT-based anthropologist who has been studying Las Vegas and the culture of gambling for more than fifteen years. Sch\xc3\xbcll is the author of Addiction by Design., Regardless of how you feel about basketball, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to appreciate the way it can bring groups of strangers together to share moments of pure adulation and collective defeat.That moment when time is running out, the team is down by one, a player arcs the ball from downtown just as the buzzer sounds\xe2\x80\x94and sinks it. It\xe2\x80\x99s exhilarating. It\xe2\x80\x99s heart breaking. And most of all, it\xe2\x80\x99s good design. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not the way basketball was originally designed.During pro basketball\xe2\x80\x99s infancy in the 1950s, nothing forced a player to shoot the ball. If a team was winning, and they wanted to keep their lead, the team could literally hold on to the ball for ten minutes and run the clock out.But in 1954, Syracuse Nationals owner Danny Biasone had crunched some numbers, and he believed that some simple arithmetic could save basketball.Reporter Eric Mennel, from the radio show BackStory with the American History Guys, spoke with Dolph Schayes\xe2\x80\x94who played on the Syracuse Nationals both before and after the advent of the shot clock\xe2\x80\x94about how Biasone\xe2\x80\x99s contribution to the game shaped basketball into what it has become today., On the streets of early 20th Century America, nothing moved faster than 10 miles per hour. Responsible parents would tell their children, \xe2\x80\x9cGo outside, and play in the streets. All day.\xe2\x80\x9dAnd then the automobile happened. And then automobiles began killing thousands of children, every year.Many viewed the car as a death machine. One newspaper cartoon even compared the car to Moloch, the god to whom the Ammonites supposedly sacrificed their children.At first, pedestrian deaths were considered public tragedies. Parades were held in dozens of cities to commemorate the dead children. Cities built monuments. Mothers of children killed in the streets are given a special White Star to honor their loss.The main cause for these deaths was that the rules of the street were vastly different than they are today. A street functioned like a city park, or a pedestrian mall, where you could move in any direction without really thinking about it. The only moving hazards were animals and other people.But automotive interests wanted to claim the streets for cars.So they put forth a radical idea--cars weren\'t to blame, it was human recklessness. They found that they could exonerate the machine by placing the blame on individuals.They also coined a new term: "Jaywalking.", Wherever there is sufficient demand to move between two points of differing elevation, there are stairs. In some hilly neighborhoods of California--if you know where to look--you\'ll find public, outdoor staircases.The large number of hidden public staircases is part of what makes California so great. Charles Fleming is one of the world experts of coastal California\'s public stairs. He has documented and mapped walking routes through nearly every useable public staircase in San Francisco\'s East Bay, as well as in Los Angeles (where he lives). Charles published his findings in two walking guides, appropriately titled Secret Stairs.Producer Sam Greenspan met with Charles in the Pacific Palisades, where people from all over Los Angeles had gathered to attend one of Charles\' monthly stair walks., There was a time when every street sign, every billboard, and every window display was made by a sign artist with a paint kit and an arsenal of squirrel- or camel-hair brushes. Some lived an itinerant lifestyle, traveling from town to town, knocking on the doors of local shops, asking if they could paint their signs.This was the way things were until as recently as the 1980s, when everything was upended by the vinyl plotter. Now, sign-making was faster, easier, and cheaper than ever before. Moreover, vinyl signs didn\xe2\x80\x99t require any skill to make. But over time, they created an environment of anonymity and impermanence. Hand painted signs began to disappear. But not completely.Our contributor Benjamen Walker spoke with Faythe Levine and Sam Macon about their new book and documentary film, Sign Painters, which profiles more than two dozen contemporary sign painters keeping the tradition alive. Benjamen also spoke with sign painter and cartoonist Justin Green, who draws the comic series Sign Game (among others).Our own Sam Greenspan visited New Bohemia Signs in San Francisco to get their take on the sign painting scene., There comes a time in the life of a modern city where it begins to grow up--literally. Santiago, the capital of Chile, has been going through a tremendous growth spurt since its economic boom of the mid 1990s. It happened fast. In just a few years, single family homes all over the city were replaced with high rises.A man named Rodrigo Rojas played a small part in Santiago\xe2\x80\x99s "upward mobility"--which wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be that remarkable if he were an engineer, a real estate developer, or an architect. But Rodrigo Rojas is a poet.This is how it worked: A developer bought an old house, tore it down, and had an architect draw up plans for a high rise. And then Rodrigo stepped in to give the building a name. Rodrigo even fabricated whole stories in the service of building an identity. He came up with one story about a ship called the Zanzibar, a luxury liner built with the Titanic, but slightly smaller. You\'ve never heard of it, he explained, because the Zanzibar never sank.Our reporter this week is Daniel Alarc\xc3\xb3n, host and executive producer of Radio Ambulante., Like many cities in Central Europe, Warsaw is made up largely of grey, ugly, communist block-style architecture. Except for one part: The Old Town.Walking through this historic district, it\xe2\x80\x99s just like any other quaint European city. There are tourist shops, horse-drawn carriage rides, church spires. The buildings are beautiful--but they are not original.During World War II, Nazi forces razed more than 80% of Warsaw. After Soviet troops took over, much of the city was rebuilt in the with communist style: fast, cheap, and big. They built apartment blocks, wide avenues, and heavy grey buildings. It was communist ideology in architectural form.But when it came to the historic district of Warsaw-- the Old Town and a long connecting section called the Royal Route--they decided not just to rebuild, but to restore. Builders would use the same stones, and use special kilns to make special bricks to preserve its authenticity. After six years of reconstruction, the new Old Town was opened. Poles were ecstatic to have it back. Even in the West, it was seen as a triumph of the human spirit.But here\'s the thing: Warsaw\xe2\x80\x99s historic Old Town is not a replica of the original. It\xe2\x80\x99s a re-imagining. An historic city that never really was.Reporters and producers Amy Drozdowska and Dave McGuire talk with social anthropologist Michael Murawski about the fake recreation of Old Town and what it means to modern Warsaw., Though its officially name is JFK Plaza, the open space near Philadelphia\xe2\x80\x99s City Hall is more commonly known as LOVE Park. With its sleek granite benches, geometric raised planter beds, and long expanses of pavement, its success as a pedestrian plaza is debatable. But it turned out to be perfect for skateboarding. As skateboarding culture grew in the 1990s, LOVE Park became a Mecca of the skating world--even though skateboarding was officially banned there.Skateboarder and radio producer Andrew Norton takes us for a ride through the surprising history of LOVE Park, and pulls back the curtain on a decades-old battle over public space in Philadelphia and beyond., When Eric Molinsky lived in Los Angeles, he kept hearing this story about a bygone transportation system called the Red Car. The Red Car, he was told, had been this amazing network of streetcars that connected the city--until a car company bought it, dismantled it, and forced a dependency on freeways.But like most legends, the one that Eric heard about the Red Car is not entirely accurate. It\'s true that Los Angeles did have an extensive mass transit system called the Red Car, which at one time ran on 1,100 miles of track--about 25 percent more more track mileage than New York City has today, a century later.But the Red Car wasn\'t the victim of a conspiracy. The Red Car WAS the conspiracy., If you\xe2\x80\x99re not from California, or missed this bit of news, the University of California has a new logo. Or rather had a new logo. To be more precise they had a new \xe2\x80\x9cvisual identity system,\xe2\x80\x9d which is the kind of entirely accurate but completely wonky description that gets met with sarcastic eyerolls from anyone who isn\xe2\x80\x99t a designer, but there it is. But they don\xe2\x80\x99t have a new anything anymore. Because of a massive public backlash, the UC system actually suspended the entire new brand identity while we were reporting this story.In this episode, we talk to the Creative Director of the UC Office of the President, Vanessa Correa, who led the team that created this short-lived brand identity and Christopher Simmons, principal of MINE, who waded into the UC logo fight with a brilliant blog post called \xe2\x80\x9cWhy the UC Rebrand is Better Than You Think.\xe2\x80\x9dFourth generation UC Berkeley alum, Cyrus Farivar (see episodes #36 and #55, true believers) takes a look at the new UC identity and chronicles its tumultuous life and rapid death. We also use this opportunity to ruminate on the topic of how and when a design should be judged., I want you to conjure an image in your mind of the white stripes that divide the lanes of traffic going the same direction on a major highway. How long are the stripes and the spaces between them?You can spread your arms out to estimate if you want to.Over the course of many years, a psychology researcher named Dennis Schafer at Ohio State asked students from many different parts of the country this question and the most common response was that the white stripes are two feet long.Tom Vanderbilt, author of the brilliant book Traffic: Why We Drive the Way We Do (and What It Says About Us), reveals the real answer and some of the other perceptual countermeasures that are designed to make you feel comfortable going way faster than your brain can adequately process.We also talk about how this design language of exaggerated scale and wide vistas is great for limited access highways, but it\xe2\x80\x99s problematic when these features are grafted onto suburban landscapes where they don\xe2\x80\x99t belong., When Melissa Lee was growing up in Hastings-on-Hudson, a small town in upstate New York, there were only so many fun things to do. One was buying geodes and smashing them apart with a hammer. (You know geodes, right? Those dull-looking brown rocks that you break open to reveal crystalline structures inside?)One day, when Melissa was thirteen, she and her friend Liz bought some geodes. They didn\'t want to wait to get home to crack them open, so they decided to throw them against the wall of an apartment building. Liz\'s aim went wild, and the geode went through a window.Melissa and Liz tried to find person whose window they had broken, but they couldn\'t figure out which door in the apartment building lead to the unit with the window in question. Eventually they gave up.Melissa would have probably forgotten about the incident had it not been for one inexplicable thing: the window didn\'t get fixed. Ever.It was clear that someone lived there. Melissa would walk by the window and see the apartment lit up by a TV. Someone was opening the window in the summer, and closing it in the winter. But the hole remained.Melissa finished middle school, then high school, then went away to college. And when she came home and saw the window still broken, it had this effect of making her feel like the nervous, insecure thirteen year old she was when she broke the window.This became a pattern for Melissa: she\'d leave home, do some growing up, come home, see the window, and feel like a teenager.Melissa traveled the world. She went to graduate school, She moved to Washington, DC, She got married. And every time she\'d come home, she\'d see the window. "As much as I was changing, this part of my past was completely frozen," Melissa says. "As soon as I saw the window I was brought right back to those middle school days when we had broken it."So in 2011, 22 years after the incident, Melissa went to go find the person who left the window broken for so long. She brought along a tape recorder., Kowloon Walled City was the densest place in the world, ever.By its peak in the 1990s, the 6.5 acre Kowloon Walled City was home to at least 33,000 people (with estimates of up to 50,000). That\'s a population density of at least 3.2 million per square mile. For New York City to get that dense, every man, woman, and child living in Texas would have to move to Manhattan.To put it another way, think about living in a 1,200 square foot home. Then imagine yourself living with 9 other people. Then imagine that your building is only one unit of a twelve-story building, and every other unit is as full as yours. Then imagine hundreds those buildings crammed together in a space the size of four football fields.We can\'t really imagine it, either.Kowloon Walled City began as a military fort in Kowloon, a region in mainland China. In 1898, China signed a land lease with Great Britain, giving the British control of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and other nearby territories. But the lease stipulated that the fort in Kowloon would remain under Chinese jurisdiction.Over time, the fort became abandoned, leaving the area subject to neither Chinese nor British authority. This legal gray zone was attractive to displaced and marginalized people. Thousands of people moved there after the war with Japan broke out. Even more people moved there after the Communist Revolution. It attracted gangsters, drug addicts, sex workers, and refugees. And it also drew a lot of normal people from all over China who saw opportunity there.They built the city building by building, first blanketing the area of the fort, then building vertically. Buildings were packed together so tightly in the Walled City that the alleys were nearly pitch-black in the day time. Electricity and water were brought in by illegal or informal means.The Walled City gained a reputation as a sort of den of iniquity--there were high levels of prostitution, gambling, mafia activity, and, for some reason, rampant unlicensed dentistry.But an order did emerge. The Walled City had no schools, but there was an informal kindergarten. A resident\'s organization settled disputes. And there was lots of industry: a fishball factory, a noodle factory, metalworking shops, a textile mill. There were stores, restaurants. You could even receive mail in the Walled City.Kowloon Walled City was torn down in 1993. Today, it\'s a park, and most traces of the city are gone. But the memory of the city lives on. It was featured in the non-verbal film Baraka, plays a cameo role in Bloodsport. It\'s also served as the setting in a number of video games, including most recently Call of Duty: Black OpsThis week\'s episode was produced by Nick van der Kolk. He spoke with photographer Greg Girard and architect Aaron Tan, who both spent time in the Walled City. Nick also talked to as Brian Douglas, who helped design Call of Duty: Black Ops.Nick is the director of the award-winning podcast, Love + Radio. You can also hear him over at Snap Judgment., When most people think of camouflage they think of blending in with the environment, but camouflage can also take the opposite approach.It has long been hypothesized that stripes on zebras make it difficult for a predator to distinguish one zebra from another when the zebras are in a large herd. The stripes also might make zebras less attractive to blood sucking horseflies. This is called disruptive camouflage.When it comes to humans, the greatest, most jaw-droppingly spectacular application of disruptive camouflage was called Dazzle.Dazzle painting emerged in the 1910s as design solution to a very dire problem: American and British ships were being sunk left and right by German U-Boats. England needed to import supplies to fight the Central Powers, and these ships were sitting ducks in the Atlantic Ocean. They needed a way to fend of the torpedoes.Conventional high-similarity camouflage just doesn\'t work in the open sea. Conditions like the color of the sky, cloud cover, and wave height change all the time, not to mention the fact that there\'s no way to hid all the smoke left by the ships\' smoke stacks.The strategy of this high-difference, dazzle camouflage was not about invisibility. It was about disruption. Confusion.Torpedoes in the Great War could only be fired line-of-sight, so instead of firing at where they saw the ship was at that moment, torpedo gunners would have to chart out where the ship would be by the time the torpedo got there. They had to determine the target ship\'s speed and direction with just a brief look through the periscope.The torpedo gunner\'s margin of error for hitting a ship was quite low. Dazzle painting could throw off an experienced submariner by as much as 55 degrees.Our expert this week is Roy Behrens, a professor graphic design at the University of Northern Iowa. He\'s published several books about camouflage, and also runs the Camoupedia blog., In the Cape Cod town of Woods Hole, buildings are not usually dome-shaped. Producer Katie Klocksin was pretty surprised when she came across one.Katie started asking around about the dome.\xc2\xa0 She found it was built by the late Buckminster Fuller, who called himself a "comprehensive anticipatory design scientist," out to solve the problems confronting "Starship Earth" by changing the way we make buildings.\xc2\xa0 "Bucky" Fuller invented and patented the geodesic dome, a spherical structure made from small triangles.\xc2\xa0 The design is based on a lot of complicated math, but the idea is that by relying on the strength of of the triangle, these buildings could be made from cheaper materials, like plastic and aluminum instead of steel and concrete.In 1953, Fuller was commissioned to build a dome in Woods Hole by architect (and aspiring restauranteur) Gunnar Peterson.\xc2\xa0 The dome would become the posh Dome Restaurant.\xc2\xa0 Diners could gaze through the building\'s triangular windows out on onto the sea.\xc2\xa0 A zither player named Ruth Welcome entertained guests.Despite its Utopian aspirations, the building had some structural problems.\xc2\xa0 The glass windows heated the restaurant up like a greenhouse, so the owner installed fiberglass over most of the dome, blocking the ocean views.\xc2\xa0 It leaked constantly, and was difficult to maintain.\xc2\xa0 Even though the Woods Hole dome did not radically change the world, Bucky Fuller would go on to become one of the most influential thinkers in design and architecture of the 20th Century.Today, the Dome Restaurant lies vacant. A new development project could lead to the dome\'s restoration, but for now, it remains a decaying curiosity, inviting exploration from microphone-wielding out-of-towners., On this special edition of 99% Invisible, we joined forces with Andrea Seabrook of DecodeDC to investigate all the thought that goes into the most miniscule details of a political campaign. Andrea was the star of episode #48 of 99% Invisible, The Bathtubs or the Boiler Room.Andrea reveals seven (and a half) secrets about the staging of events along the campaign trail.\xc2\xa0 Like how every campaign has an \xe2\x80\x9cAdvance Team\xe2\x80\x9d that flies in ahead of a candidate and makes everything from a campaign rally to a 20-minute media appearance run smoothly.Andrea spoke with Advance guys John Seaton and Donnie Fowler, who have been directing this very American brand of political theater for years., Benjamen Walker had a theory that priority queues are changing the American experience of waiting in line. So he visited amusement parks, highways, and community colleges to find out how these priority queues work and who is using them. What started as an episode of 99% Invisible became a half-hour radio documentary for the BBC.Along the way Walker met the man that may be responsible for the reason why many Americans know the word \xe2\x80\x9cqueue\xe2\x80\x9d at all: Neil Hunt from Netflix. He has been trying to abandon the word ever since he introduced it into the DVD service over a decade ago.Walker also met up with Susan Crawford, a net neutrality advocate, who thinks that queues are a good way to examine the pitfalls with what she calls the \xe2\x80\x9ccablelization\xe2\x80\x9d of the internet. Comcast has taken the lead in providing high-speed internet to consumers, but people like the CEO of Netflix have been critical of Comcast favoring its own video content over video from third party services such as Netflix and HBO Go. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s concerns go way beyond streaming video to the heart of the net neutrality debate: is a market without any meaningful competition a safe place to determine the future of communications in this country?Maybe we should all move to Kansas City., Pneumatic (adj.):\xc2\xa0 of, or pertaining to, air, gases, or wind.In the world before telephone, radio, and email, the tasks of transmitting information and moving material objects were essentially the same challenge.\xc2\xa0 The way you sent someone a message was pretty much the same process as sending someone a package\xe2\x80\x94you had to send a piece of physical media through the post, or on a ship.It was really the telegraph that divided telling someone something from far away and\xc2\xa0 giving someone something from far away. But every day people didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak morse code (or have telegraph equipment).\xc2\xa0 The message had to be deciphered, written on a slip of paper, and then that was delivered to the recipient. For many cities, the pneumatic tube was essential in getting these slips of paper to the intended recipient quickly.It\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise that electronic communication eventually killed most of the need for pneumatic tubes. But you may not know that it was the telegraph itself that also put pneumatic tubes into widespread use.Architectural historian and pneumatic tube aficionada Molly Wright Steenson leads us through the rise and fall (but not disappearance of) pneumatic tubes in Paris, and beyond., I only recently started listening to BackStory with the American History Guys, but it\xe2\x80\x99s already earned a top spot in my crowded weekly rotation. With great stories and lively discussion, the \xe2\x80\x9cHistory Guys\xe2\x80\x9d connect our history to the present day. They\xe2\x80\x99ll also help you win your next argument about the causes of the War of 1812. Be prepared. This happens.In this piece from their \xe2\x80\x9cMonumental Disagreements\xe2\x80\x9d episode, BackStory producers Eric Mennel and Nell Boeschenstein visit Harper\xe2\x80\x99s Ferry, West Virginia to tell the story of a monument in honor of Heyward Shepherd, a \xe2\x80\x9cfree black,\xe2\x80\x9d and the first man killed during John Brown\xe2\x80\x99s 1859 raid.Season 3 starts on September 19!, While we\xe2\x80\x99re gearing up for season 3, we present two pieces from two shows we love:First up, Language Bites from RTE Choice in Ireland. Language Bites is a series of 1-minute programs exploring the origins of popular phrases in the English language. It\xe2\x80\x99s presented by Colette Kinsella and sound designed by Lochlainn Harte. This episode is about the origin of the word \xe2\x80\x9cstorey\xe2\x80\x9d (or in American English \xe2\x80\x9cstory\xe2\x80\x9d) when used to refer to a level of a building. There are 80 episodes in the series and I just adore them. They are in heavy rotation on the radio stream/station I curate for PRX called Public Radio Remix.Our second selection is from Nate Dimeo\xe2\x80\x99s brilliant show, the memory palace. Each episode of the memory palace features pointedly short, surprising stories about the past. It\xe2\x80\x99s sometimes heartbreaking, sometimes hysterical, and often a wonderful mix of both. It was also a huge inspiration in the creation of 99% Invisible. This episode is about the beautiful sculpture and star map commemorating the Hoover Dam., New Public Sites is an investigation into some of the invisible sites and overlooked features of our everyday public spaces. These are the liminal spaces within cities that are not traditionally framed as \xe2\x80\x9cpublic space\xe2\x80\x9d because, quite frankly, they are often ugly and unpleasant, the leftover scraps of urban design centered on the automobile. By giving these places succinct, fun and poetic names and leading people on playful walking tours, Graham Coreil-Allen says we can help start a discourse about our public spaces and how we want to envision them for the future. You can download a pdf of the New Public Sites book here., Sean Cole is a poet and he knows what you think of that.He is also a radio producer. One night, drunk and stumbling around the Hudson River with his friend Malissa O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell, he discovered a monument \xe2\x80\x94 two of them actually \xe2\x80\x94 to two of his poetry heroes. Apropos of the name of this show, the tribute wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very obvious. In fact, he and Malissa nearly walked right past it. Still, embedded in the architecture of a 25 year old plaza were the words of Walt Whitman and Frank O\xe2\x80\x99Hara. And weirdly, Sean had he\xe2\x80\x99d been reciting from O\xe2\x80\x99Hara\xe2\x80\x99s Lunch Poems just minutes before.Thus began Sean\xe2\x80\x99s quest to talk to the people whose idea this was \xe2\x80\x94 forging a largely unloved art form into a permanent fixture of the cultural landscape. Along the way he talks with urban landscape architect M. Paul Friedberg, former Battery Park official Richard Kahan and none other than Frank O\xe2\x80\x99Hara\xe2\x80\x99s younger sister, Maureen O\xe2\x80\x99Hara.Sean Cole and Malissa O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell both work for WNYC\xe2\x80\x99s Radiolab. And Sean is also a 99-percentilist from way back., What\xe2\x80\x99s the difference between what the public sees and what an architect sees when they look at a building?The hotel on the very prominent corner of Touhy and Kilbourn Avenues in Lincolnwood, Illinois used to be the town\xe2\x80\x99s most famous building: The first Hyatt hotel in all of Chicagoland, premiere accommodations, top-notch restaurant. It was swank! Roberta Flack stayed there. Barry Mannilow stayed there. Perry Como. Michael Jordon stayed there on his first night in Chicago. Every thirteen year old boy in the area had his bar mitzvah there.Then, slowly, over time, it became Lincolnwood\xe2\x80\x99s most infamous building. Changed hands, got seedy and run down. It was the home of the Midwest Fetish Fair and Marketplace convention. There were drug-fueled sex parties attended by shady Chicago politicians later convicted of things like extortion. And of course there was the convicted mobster Alan Dorfman, who was gunned down in the parking lot. It\xe2\x80\x99s now dilapidated and empty.But even if you know nothing about the history, everyone in the area knows this hotel.Because it\xe2\x80\x99s purple. Really, really purple.Gwen Macsai grew up nearby and she always thought it was really, really ugly. Lots of people did. To be fair, lots of people didn\xe2\x80\x99t. But everyone has an opinion about it.But Gwen Macsai, host of Re:sound from the Third Coast International Audio Festival, has a secret about the Purple Hotel.Gwen talks to the original architect of the Purple Hotel, plus WBEZ architecture critic Lee Bey, developer Jack Weiss, and the new architect, Jackie Koo, who\xe2\x80\x99s looking to bring the Purple Hotel back to its former glory., This is the Kickstarter video for funding the new season of 99% Invisible. If you enjoy the show and want to help keep it going, now is the time to go to our funding page and chip in a little. During the campaign, any amount that you can give matters a lot, because if we don\'t make the goal, even by one dollar, we don\'t receive any of the funds that have been pledged. Plus, right now there are some amazing thank you gifts available for your donation. Thanks so much for listening and for helping us out.New episode any day, probably tomorrow. Thanks!, Starlee Kine\xe2\x80\x99s friend Noel works in advertising. In 2003, Noel was working in at an agency in Richmond, VA. Everyone wanted to work on flashy spots like Apple or Nike or Gatorade. Do you know what wasn\xe2\x80\x99t flashy? Insurance. Which is why when a company called Geico became a client everyone hoped the campaign wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t end up on their desk. Noel ultimately got stuck with Geico. His job was help them somehow figure out a clever, not painfully boring way to explain how simple it was for people to sign up for their insurance online.Maybe you see where this is going.But you don\xe2\x80\x99t know where it came from.Starlee Kine guides us back the surprising, culturally rich path of inspiration that ultimately resulted in a commercial for an insurance company.This story originally appeared at Pop Up Magazine #6 in San Francisco., Goethe said, \xe2\x80\x9cArchitecture is frozen music.\xe2\x80\x9d I like that.Of course that was before audio recording, so now, for the most part, music is frozen music.It\xe2\x80\x99s only very recently in the history of music that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to freeze music into an object. In my life, the form of this object mattered a lot. I once bought vinyl albums and cassette tapes, where there were two first songs per album, Side A and Side B. The energy of a first song makes it stand apart, at least in my head it does. Then the CD came along and eliminated Side B and there was only first song, and the actual number of a track (that you see prominently on the UI) became my index for sorting songs. Then MP3s jumbled my sense of track order, and albums began to feel more like a loose grouping of individual pieces rather than a conceptual whole. I could name hundreds more examples like these, and I welcome you to chime in, but my point is: the form of the thing matters.But no effect has been as world changing as that original innovation: freezing music in time onto a recording, where a single version of a song, a single performance of a song, became the song. An inherently mutable method of communication was fundamentally changed.I heard a radio broadcast several years ago that really affected the way I thought about all this. Jim Derogatis and Greg Kot are the hosts of a radio program I\xe2\x80\x99m a huge fan of called Sound Opinions (subscribe now). The songwriter, composer, and producer, Jon Brion came to WBEZ in Chicago to talk to Sound Opinions in 2006. At the time, Brion has just co-produced Kanye West\xe2\x80\x99s album Late Registration and he was also already a renowned film composer. In this interview, Brion talks about the difference between what he calls \xe2\x80\x9cperformance pieces\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csongs\xe2\x80\x9d and how recorded music has changed the way we appreciate the different art forms.Special thanks to Sound Opinions for allowing me to rebroadcast this segment., If you\xe2\x80\x99re a beer nerd, or have a friend who\xe2\x80\x99s a beer nerd, you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of Belgian beers. Belgians take beer very seriously. Amongst the 200 Belgian breweries, there\xe2\x80\x99s a very specific sub-type: Trappist beers.According to our reporter Cyrus Farivar (also from Episode #36 \xe2\x80\x9cSuper Bonn Bon\xe2\x80\x9d), there are two things you need to know about Trappist beers. First, they\xe2\x80\x99re amazing. Second, they\xe2\x80\x99re made by Trappist monks. These monks trace their roots to a monastery in 17th century France, and have since spread out to all over the world.The main concept behind the Trappist lifestyle is that the abbey should be economically self-sufficient. In other words, the monks should make something and sell it to the public as a way to fund the operations of the abbey itself. Some make cheese. Some make spirits. There\xe2\x80\x99s even one in Germany that makes lentil soup. But none of the Trappist products are as famous as the beer.The beer that is considered the best of the best is Westvleteren 12. With its plain brown bottle, no label, the only writing is on the cap- the beer is super cool. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite rare and year after year it\xe2\x80\x99s rated the best beer in the world.But here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing about Westvleteren. You can\xe2\x80\x99t just go there and have as much beer as you want. You can\xe2\x80\x99t even have it shipped from the abbey. If you want to buy beer to take with you, you have to look up the beer reservation phone number on the abbey\xe2\x80\x99s website. Then, you call certain phone number during certain hours, on certain days.If you\xe2\x80\x99re lucky enough to talk to a monk to take your reservation, you have to give your license plate number and be available to come pick up your crate during the appointed time that weekend. You\xe2\x80\x99re limited to one crate per person per car, maximum two per car. And, you can\xe2\x80\x99t buy more than one crate during a 60-day period. You also have to agree not to resell the beer.This sort of thing is not unheard of: velvet ropes and random reward have long been imposed to create artificial scarcity to heighten demand, but the mainstream trend today seems to be more geared toward greater access and accommodation for customers. The new ideal is that everything is available, at all times, no matter where you live. Yet the Westvleteren Trappists are trying to make it as difficult as possible.Jef van den Steen, author of a book called Trappist: The Seven Heavenly Beers and an acclaimed brewer himself, says that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case, \xe2\x80\x9cBefore, Westvleteren was only well-known was in Belgium. And now it\xe2\x80\x99s worldwide, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the problem. They decide we will brew the same amount as the last 40-50 years, and they have enough for that, so why must they brew more? Because you want? No. They live between the walls of the abbey, so for them it\xe2\x80\x99s not a problem.\xe2\x80\x9dThe \xe2\x80\x9ccustomer service\xe2\x80\x9d is not designed to provide convenience for the consumer of their beer, it is designed for monks themselves. Their \xe2\x80\x9ccustomer\xe2\x80\x9d is God, so to speak. They have a mission, and making beer is only a fraction of that. The Head of the Abbey says, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are not brewers. We are monks. We brew beer to be able to afford being monks.\xe2\x80\x9dCyrus Farivar recently returned to California after having lived in Bonn, Germany for two years. These days, he can be found frequenting The Trappist bar in downtown Oakland. He plans on presenting a bottle of Westvleteren 12 to his favorite bar owners. His book, The Internet of Elsewhere, was published last year., US paper currency is so ubiquitous that to really look at its graphic design with fresh eyes requires some deliberate and focused attention. So pull out a greenback from your wallet (or look at a picture one online) and just take really take it in. All the fonts, the busy filigree, the micro patterns\xe2\x80\xa6it\xe2\x80\x99s just dreadful.Even though paper currency itself, just idea of money, is a massive, world changing technology, the look and feel of US paper money is very stagnant. Richard Smith is the founder of the Dollar ReDe$ign Project and in an article in the New York Times, he pointed out five major areas where the design of US currency could improve: color, size, functionality, composition, and symbolism.It just so happens that Australian currency addresses each and every one of the points made by Richard Smith. Tristan Cooke and Tom Nelson of the blog Humans in Design are big fans of all the design innovations in Australian money. Aussie polymer notes are varied in color, get larger with each denomination, are more durable and are generally considered better and easier to use than US currency.But there are some interesting reasons why the greenback is the way it is. David Wolman, author of The End of Money, explains that the legacy features that make US paper money look stale and anachronistic are meant to convey stability and timelessness. Since the US economy is so important in the world economy, why mess with it? Some fear that changing the design of the currency significantly (or eliminating the penny) could undermine the faith in the federal reserve note.Even though Tristan and Tom are fans of the Australian polymer bills, they share Wolman\xe2\x80\x99s view that the more interesting future innovations are not going to have anything to do with physical cash. Clever user interfaces that help us manage our money better, while providing even greater convenience, are getting more refined and accepted. So that ugly $20 in your wallet may never actually get prettier and more functional, it\xe2\x80\x99ll just be gone., What happens when we build big?Julia Barton remembers going to the top floor of Dallas\xe2\x80\x99s then-new city hall when she was teenager. The building, designed by I.M. Pei, is a huge trapezoid jutting out over a wide plaza. Julia found the view from th..., Even during the construction of the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge, the deck would go up and down by several feet with the slightest breeze. Construction workers on the span chewed on lemon wedges to stop their motion sickness. They nicknamed the structure Galloping Gertie.The original Tacoma Narrows Bridge design by Clark Eldridge was pretty conventional for a suspension bridge, but it was later modified by Leon Moisseiff to be slimmer and more elegant. The most notable change was that the 25 foot lattice of stiffening trusses underneath the bridge on the original drawings, were replaced with 8 foot solid steel plate girders. The new solid girder along the side in Moisseiff\xe2\x80\x99s design made for a much lighter and more flexible bridge\xe2\x80\x94 it also caught the wind like a sail\xe2\x80\x94 but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that. Moisseiff\xe2\x80\x99s design was also 2/3 the price of the original Eldridge design and that fact ultimately won the day.Motorists who used the bridge found out first hand why it got the name Galloping Gertie, and during the four months while the bridge was open, many traveled from far away just to ride the undulating waves as they crossed high above Puget Sound. The thrill ride didn\xe2\x80\x99t last long.On November 7, 1940 stiff winds caused the road deck to twist violently along its center axis. The center span endured these brutal torsional forces for about an hour and finally gave way.The collapse of the twisting suspension bridge is one of the most dramatic images caught on film.I talked to John Marr from the seminal zine Murder Can Be Fun for this story and I\xe2\x80\x99d like to give a shout out to Alan Bellows of Damn Interesting for independently suggesting Galloping Gertie as a show topic and publishing a great, much more detailed account of the disaster on his site.Special thanks to Benjamen Walker for the audio of Kathryn Schulz. That interview originally aired on his show Too Much Information in the episode called \xe2\x80\x9cMistakes Were Made.\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cCities exist to bring people together, but cities can also keep people apart\xe2\x80\x9d - Daniel D\xe2\x80\x99Oca, Urban Planner, Interboro Partners.Cities are great. They have movement, activity and diversity. But go to any city and it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear, a place can be diverse without really being integrated. This segregation isn\xe2\x80\x99t accidental. There are design elements in the urban landscape, that Daniel D\xe2\x80\x99Oca calls \xe2\x80\x9cweapons,\xe2\x80\x9d that are used by \xe2\x80\x9carchitects, planners, policy-makers, developers, real estate brokers, community activists, neighborhood associations, and individuals to wage the ongoing war between integration and segregation.\xe2\x80\x9dDaniel D\xe2\x80\x99Oca is an urban planner with Interboro Partners, an architecture and design firm based in New York City. Over the past few years, D\xe2\x80\x99Oca, along with colleagues Tobias Armborst and Georgeen Theodore have been cataloging all the stuff inside of a city that planners use to increase or restrict people\xe2\x80\x99s access to space. They\xe2\x80\x99re publishing their findings in a book called The Arsenal of Inclusion and Exclusion: 101 Things That Open And Close the City (Fall 2012).D\xe2\x80\x99Oca took our own Sam Greenspan and Scott Goldberg on a tour of Baltimore to demonstrate the subtle ways different neighborhoods are kept apart., The acoustics of a building are a big concern for architects. But for designers at Gallaudet University in Washington, DC, it\xe2\x80\x99s the absence of sound that defines the approach to architecture.Gallaudet is a university dedicated to educating the deaf and hard of hearing, and since 2005, they\xe2\x80\x99ve re-thought principles of architecture with one question at the forefront: how do deaf people communicate in space?Unlike hearing people, the deaf have to keep sightlines in order to maintain conversations. So when deaf people walk and talk, they\xe2\x80\x99ll lock into a kind of dance. Going through a doorway, one person will spin in place and walk backwards to keep talking. Walking past a column, two deaf people in conversation will move in tandem to avoid collision.Spaces designed for the hearing can also give the deaf a great deal of anxiety \xe2\x80\x93 when you can\xe2\x80\x99t hear footsteps from around the corner or behind you, you can\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate who or what is around you.Robert Sirvage is a deaf designer, researcher, and instructor at Gallaudet, and in collaboration with Hansel Bauman \xe2\x80\x94 who is not deaf \xe2\x80\x93 and a group of staff, students and architects, they\xe2\x80\x99ve developed a project called DeafSpace. Reporter Tom Dreisbach took a tour through the new building at Gallaudet that is incorporating the innovations of DeafSpace to create an environment more pleasing to everyone, both hearing and deaf., In the US, it\xe2\x80\x99s called a line.In Canada, it\xe2\x80\x99s often referred to as a line-up.Pretty much everywhere else, it\xe2\x80\x99s known as a queue.My friend Benjamen Walker is obsessed with queues. He keeps sending me YouTube clips of queue violence. This preoccupation led him to find a man known as \xe2\x80\x9cDr. Queue.\xe2\x80\x9d Richard Larson is a queue theorist at MIT and he talks us through some of the logic behind the design of queues.Whereas US companies like Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s and American Airlines once prided themselves on their invention of the single, serpentine, first-come first-served queue, more and more companies are instituting priority queues, offering different wait times for different classes of customers., \xe2\x80\x9cI have this habit of walking into any door that\xe2\x80\x99s unlocked\xe2\x80\xa6You start poking around, going into doors\xe2\x80\xa6you find the coolest things\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d-Andrea Seabrook, NPR Congressional CorrespondentIn the eight years Andrea Seabrook has been reporting on Congress, she has made it a point to get to know the whole Capitol building. \xe2\x80\x9cThe members of the House Republican Caucus\xe2\x80\x93and sometimes the Democrats\xe2\x80\x93meet in the basement for their closed door secret strategy sessions,\xe2\x80\x9d Andrea says. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s really good place to get a tip from members that you know about what\xe2\x80\x99s going on.\xe2\x80\x9d One day, after getting the info she needed for her story, she decided to press further on into the depths of the Capitol.That\xe2\x80\x99s when she found the marble bathtubs.The bathtubs were installed around 1860 during the expansion of the Capitol. DC is known for its swampy summers, and legend has it that senators could be banished from the chamber if they were too smelly. But lawmakers\xe2\x80\x93like most Americans at the time\xe2\x80\x93didn\xe2\x80\x99t have indoor plumbing at home. They needed a place where they could wash up.So the Architect of the Capitol ordered six marble bath tubs, each three by seven feet and carved by hand in Italy, to be installed in the Capitol basement\xe2\x80\x93three on the House side, three on the senate. Today, only two tubs remain on the Senate side, in a room which now stores the building\xe2\x80\x99s heating and cooling equipment. But evidence of room\xe2\x80\x99s former grandeur remains., Somebody might be able to do a great painting that\xe2\x80\x99s 20 x 30 inches, but you take that down to 1 x 1.5 inches, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a challenge to make it work.-Ethel Kessler, Art Director for USPS Stamp ServicesStamps design takes, on average, a year to a year and a half, from conception to execution. Unfortunately, most of the stamps we encounter on a day-to-day basis are the rather predictable flag, bell, and love stamps, but there are some really fantastic commemorative stamps, which are supremely functional and affordable tiny works of art.To determine what should go on a US stamp, the Citizens Stamp Advisory Committee combs through nearly 50,000 suggestions per year offered by the general public. Once the subjects are chosen and approved by the Postmaster General, they are assigned to a handful of art directors to be designed.There are loads guidelines to help stamp subject selection, but one of the big rules recently changed. In 2012, the first living person will be commemorated on an official USPS stamp.Julie Shapiro, Artistic Director of the Third Coast International Audio Festival, produced this episode. Julie spoke with Terry McCaffrey, the retired manager of stamp development for the USPS Stamp Services Office, and Ethel Kessler, an Art Director who\xe2\x80\x99s been working with Stamp Services for over 15 years., Before the 1850s, dentures were made out of very hard, very painful and very expensive material, like gold or ivory. They were a luxury item. The invention of Vulcanite hard rubber changed everything. It was moldable, it could be precisely fitted, and it was relatively cheap. Everyone began making dentures with Vulcanite bases. But in 1864, a long disputed patent application, originally filed in 1852, was awarded and then acquired by the Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Company. It was an outfit created to collect fees, or very often, sue dentists who already used vulcanite, and there were plenty of dentists to go after.The person in charge of pursuing the violators was Josiah Bacon, the treasurer of the Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Company. The patent was enforced with extreme prejudice, despite the protestations of the US dental profession.To quote the secretary of the Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Company, Ernest Caduc: \xe2\x80\x9cMany dentists\xe2\x80\xa6relying upon the secret nature of the business, prefer to steal this property rather than buy it\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9dIt all came to a head on Easter Sunday in 1879. A Vulcanite denture patent violating dentist named Samuel Chalfant went to settle his business with his pursuer, Josiah Bacon, in his San Francisco hotel room. Chalfant brought a gun.A print version of this story originally appeared in the fanzine Murder Can Be Fun by John Marr.]'

Loehr.&lt;/p&gt;, Come with us if you want to live! It\xe2\x80\x99s time for our re-watch of 1984\xe2\x80\x99s classic sci-fi/horror/monster/car chase movie \xe2\x80\x9cThe Terminator.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s a film that offers a fine distillation of everything \xe2\x80\x9980s, from Linda Hamilton\xe2\x80\x99s Guess jeans to the pulsating Casio keyboard soundtrack. How do Kyle Reese\xe2\x80\x99s stolen pants remind him of home? And whatever you do, keep an eye out for a gigantic Austrian!  &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Erika Ensign, Steve Lutz and David J. Loehr.&lt;/p&gt;, London is a thriving modern metropolis, but beneath its streets and behind its doors are ancient, magical secrets. In this episode, a group of (North) Americans discuss some of our favorite London-based urban fantasy novels. This is a spoiler-light episode, so listen in and get ready to add a whole bunch of books to your to-read list. Plus, what are we reading? &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Erika Ensign, Dan Moren and David Burkhart.&lt;/p&gt;, Set your phasers to stun and get ready for another round of our panel\xe2\x80\x99s choices for the best and worst of \xe2\x80\x9cStar Trek.\xe2\x80\x9d This time, we\xe2\x80\x99re debating the best and worst Trek series and movies. Jason and Brianna\xe2\x80\x99s mirror-universe duplicates are revealed. And Tony spends a lot of time talking about sea life. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with Mois\xc3\xa9s Chiullan, Brianna Wu, David J. Loehr, Scott McNulty and Tony Sindelar.&lt;/p&gt;, Space detectives! Pathologically honest spaceship captains! Murderous alien molecules! Solar-system-wide diplomacy! You\xe2\x80\x99ll find all this and more in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Expanse,\xe2\x80\x9d a sci-fi novel series by James S.A. Corey that\xe2\x80\x99s soon to become a SyFy channel series. The members of our Book Club highly recommend it. Also: What are we reading? &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Moren, Scott McNulty and David J. Loehr.&lt;/p&gt;, Why build fantasy sports teams when you can build a fantasy sketch-comedy team? On the occasion of the debut of season 40 of \xe2\x80\x9cSaturday Night Live,\xe2\x80\x9d we assemble six different SNL fantasy casts from the very first cast to the most recent vintage. Almost everyone gets a Phil Hartman! But only after a whole bunch of rules debates. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with David J. Loehr, Philip Michaels, Lisa Schmeiser, Lex Friedman and Monty Ashley.&lt;/p&gt;, Wind the frog and acquire more monkeys! It\xe2\x80\x99s time for us to discuss the very first computer-animated feature film, 1995\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cToy Story.\xe2\x80\x9d We ponder the rules of when toys can reveal themselves to people, question the physics of the Pizza Planet claw, and speak in defense of Sid (but not of Randy Newman). Also: Is this the end of Slinky Dog? &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with John Siracusa, Merlin Mann, Andy Ihnatko, Steve Lutz and David J. Loehr.&lt;/p&gt;, Dear Network Executives,  We know your libraries of intellectual property are full of perfectly good shows, ready to be dusted off and revived for modern audiences. That\xe2\x80\x99s why our panel of esteemed Idea Men is here to provide you with some suggestions about what shows to bring back, and how.  Also, please consider casting John Hodgman in everything. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Andy Ihnatko, Philip Michaels, Mois\xc3\xa9s Chiullan and David J. Loehr.&lt;/p&gt;, Take your flu medication, head west out of the abandoned cities, and join us for our discussion of Stephen King\xe2\x80\x99s classic novel \xe2\x80\x9cThe Stand.\xe2\x80\x9d We discuss why we enjoy (literary) apocalypses, question King\xe2\x80\x99s setting of the revised edition in 1990, and join forces with an impossibly wise Yoda figure to plan the ultimate battle between the forces of good and the forces of Vegas. Baby, can you dig your man?  Post-show: Our own personal apocalypse plans, revisited. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Erika Ensign, Lisa Schmeiser, Monty Ashley and John Siracusa.&lt;/p&gt;, Set your phasers to stun and join us for a celebration of everything we love\xe2\x80\xa6 and hate\xe2\x80\xa6 about Star Trek. Our panel of Star Trek fans picks their favorite episodes and characters! But we balance out the niceness by also picking the worst episodes and characters \xe2\x80\x9cStar Trek\xe2\x80\x9d has brought us over the years across five different TV series.  Want more Star Trek? And don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to listen to our very own Random Trek podcast, hosted by Scott McNulty. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Brianna Wu, Tony Sindelar, Scott McNulty and David J. Loehr.&lt;/p&gt;, Sharpen your shivs and barbecue some rats, because it\xe2\x80\x99s time for us to talk about the apocalyptic video game \xe2\x80\x9cThe Last of Us.\xe2\x80\x9d We talk about the story and the characters in this relentlessly bleak story of a man and a girl trying to survive both zombies and people. If you want even more, stay tuned after the music for an entire bonus episode about gameplay and technical aspects of the game.   5:10 - John\xe2\x80\x99s opening statement 8:14 - Spoiler Horn: The Last of Us 33:53 - We talk about the ending 55:14 - Spoiler Horn: Left Behind DLC 69:06 - Steve\xe2\x80\x99s leftover talking points 79:35 - Episode 208.5 (Gameplay and technology)  &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with John Siracusa, Brianna Wu, Steve Lutz and Tiffany Arment.&lt;/p&gt;, Put in your mix tape and get ready for a climactic dance-off! We\xe2\x80\x99re talking \xe2\x80\x9cGuardians of the Galaxy,\xe2\x80\x9d Marvel\xe2\x80\x99s latest hit movie and a real departure in so many ways. What makes the movie work? What are its flaws? We break it all down. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Serenity Caldwell, David J. Loehr, Monty Ashley and Tony Sindelar.&lt;/p&gt;, Oi, guv\xe2\x80\x99nor! In this episode five people from North America spend a lot of time talking about British TV we love. If you are not from the UK, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find a lot of fantastic \xe2\x80\x9cprogrammes\xe2\x80\x9d from the telly that are worth your attention. And if you are from jolly old Blighty, please laugh along as ignorant Americans assume that every TV show from England is produced by the BBC. Grab a cuppa and a curry and join us, won\xe2\x80\x99t you? &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Erika Ensign, Andy Ihnatko, Monty Ashley and David J. Loehr.&lt;/p&gt;, In the long tradition of big, giant robots came 1999\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe Iron Giant,\xe2\x80\x9d the film Brad Bird made before he made \xe2\x80\x9cThe Incredibles.\xe2\x80\x9d It was kind of a flop in its initial release, but this animated feature has become rightfully recognized as a classic. We debate the Giant\xe2\x80\x99s original purpose, break down a surprisingly large succession of poop jokes, and ponder the Giant\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate destiny to be the benevolent robot-king of Iceland. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with John Siracusa, Merlin Mann, Steve Lutz, David J. Loehr and Tony Sindelar.&lt;/p&gt;, On Comic-Con weekend, we convene to discuss the latest rash of re-casting comic book heroes. Thor is now a woman! Captain America is black! We\xe2\x80\x99re all for increasing diversity in a medium whose classic characters are dominated by white men, but what are the right ways to do it? And are there wrong ways, or does every little bit help? &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Brianna Wu, Andy Ihnatko, David J. Loehr and Monty Ashley.&lt;/p&gt;, \xe2\x80\x9cDoctor Who\xe2\x80\x9d will be returning shortly, with Peter Capaldi stepping into the role. So what if you\xe2\x80\x99re \xe2\x80\x9cDoctor Who\xe2\x80\x9d-curious, but intimidated about where to jump in? Our panel of extraordinary \xe2\x80\x9cDoctor Who\xe2\x80\x9d fans has lots of recommendations for you. Then we survey the highs and lows of the show\xe2\x80\x99s revival era, which featured Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant in the role of The Doctor. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Erika Ensign, Chip Sudderth and Glenn Fleishman.&lt;/p&gt;, Bury your dead in a Zeppelin and call your interplanetary accountant\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s time for our annual read of the Hugo Award nominees. We cover this year\xe2\x80\x99s award nominees, plus the \xe2\x80\x9cretro Hugos\xe2\x80\x9d from 1939, both of which will be awarded in August in London. Also, someone defends Mira Grant.   00:00: Introductions 04:45: Best Novel 41:18: Retro Hugos from 1939 58:41: 2014 Short Fiction 1:33:24: All the other categories 1:47:18: Goodbyes  &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Erika Ensign, Scott McNulty, Monty Ashley and David J. Loehr.&lt;/p&gt;, Break out the stars and stripes, put on your tap shoes, crawl into your shame hole, and join us for a very patriotic edition of Old Movie Club. We discuss the musical \xe2\x80\x9c1776,\xe2\x80\x9d which stars KITT from \xe2\x80\x9cKnight Rider\xe2\x80\x9d and the guy from \xe2\x80\x9cThe White Shadow,\xe2\x80\x9d and the biopic musical \xe2\x80\x9cYankee Doodle Dandy,\xe2\x80\x9d which stars James Cagney. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell       with Andy Ihnatko, Philip Michaels, David J. Loehr, Monty Ashley, Glenn Fleishman and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;, We celebrate our 200th episode with this mega-sized installment. We discuss what it means to have geeky enthusiasms (and whether we should grow up), and then listen to some reader feedback. Plus there\xe2\x80\x99s a draft, some beer, and special guest stars. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell            with John Siracusa, Serenity Caldwell, Dan Moren, Erika Ensign, Monty Ashley, Greg Knauss, Steve Lutz, David J. Loehr, Dan Benjamin, Glenn Fleishman and Scott McNulty.&lt;/p&gt;, In this episode we recap our take on the TV season that recently concluded. In a segment with little to no spoilers, we largely discuss shows we like, including \xe2\x80\x9cOrphan Black,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMarvel\xe2\x80\x99s Agents of SHIELD,\xe2\x80\x9d and even \xe2\x80\x9cThe Blacklist\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Good Wife.\xe2\x80\x9d Then at the end of the show we slip into spoiler territory and talk about season 4 of \xe2\x80\x9cGame of Thrones.\xe2\x80\x9d &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Erika Ensign, John Siracusa, David J. Loehr and Scott McNulty.&lt;/p&gt;, In this episode we convene a panel of women who love geeky stuff to discuss portrayals of girls and women in geek media, how girls and women are received in geek culture, and the books, movies, comics and TV shows that do it right. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Lisa Schmeiser, Erika Ensign and Brianna Wu.&lt;/p&gt;, We love Pixar, and we\xe2\x80\x99re a bunch of creative professional types. So as you can imagine, we devoured \xe2\x80\x9cCreativity Inc.\xe2\x80\x9d, by Pixar president Ed Catmull. Is it a business book or an anti-business book? How do you foster creativity? Is Pixar\xe2\x80\x99s formula one that provides safety while preventing works of staggering genius? How much is a director or writer the author of a Pixar movie, and how much is the studio itself? And is the wild success of \xe2\x80\x9cFrozen\xe2\x80\x9d proof of anything? &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Lisa Schmeiser, John Siracusa, Glenn Fleishman and David J. Loehr.&lt;/p&gt;, Every year Scott and Jason read all the Hugo Award-nominated novels, which supposedly show off the best science fiction has to offer. That hasn\xe2\x80\x99t always gone well, so this year they\xe2\x80\x99ve read the eight novels nominated for the Nebula Awards\xe2\x80\x94and recruited three other SF podcasters to join them in the fun. We discuss all eight novels with extremely light-to-no spoilers, so it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to listen. And the good news? All eight of these novels are pretty good! &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Scott McNulty, Fred Kiesche, Shaun Duke and Paul Weimer.&lt;/p&gt;, Following in the footsteps of our video-game draft, it\xe2\x80\x99s time for us to select some of our favorite computer games of all time. Real-time strategy! Arcade style! Text adventures! From the earliest days of video games up to the present, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got it covered. Now if we could just figure out what was in those crates\xe2\x80\xa6 &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell       with Dan Moren, Monty Ashley, Erika Ensign, Tony Sindelar, Steve Lutz and John Siracusa.&lt;/p&gt;, Grab your black cat and portable radio, climb on your mom\xe2\x80\x99s broomstick, and join us for a king-sized discussion of Hayao Miyazaki\xe2\x80\x99s classic animated film \xe2\x80\x9cKiki\xe2\x80\x99s Delivery Service.\xe2\x80\x9d This film features a climactic scene featuring an out-of-control dirigible, so you know we love it. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Merlin Mann, John Siracusa and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;, The casting for \xe2\x80\x9cStar Wars: Episode VII\xe2\x80\x9d has been announced, and so our team of interested \xe2\x80\x9cStar Wars\xe2\x80\x9d fans has arrived to break down the returning actors, the new faces, and our hopes for the future of the franchise. Plus we talk Kremlinology and Soviet industrial design, lament a bag of villains, and confuse screenwriters with pasta. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with Serenity Caldwell, Lisa Schmeiser, John Siracusa, Dan Moren and Andy Ihnatko.&lt;/p&gt;, Danger, Will Robinson! It\xe2\x80\x99s time to think outside the bots. We follow up our computer draft with a draft of favorite robots, androids, and other artificial intelligences. Also, we debate a whole lot about what makes a robot different from a computer. Kill all humans! &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with David J. Loehr, Monty Ashley, Erika Ensign and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;, Live from Macworld/iWorld in San Francisco, it\xe2\x80\x99s the Incomparable Computer Draft! We pick the best computers of all time\xe2\x80\x94real and fictional. (It goes off the rails quickly.) &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with Dan Moren, Serenity Caldwell, Jeff Carlson, Dan Frakes and David Sparks.&lt;/p&gt;, Grab your shield, steal your old uniform, and hop on your motorcycle, because it\xe2\x80\x99s time for us to discuss \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain America: The Winter Soldier.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s the latest Marvel movie, and even though Steve Rogers is the title character, there\xe2\x80\x99s an awful lot of SHIELD in this movie, too. Does the franchise aspect of these films help or hurt? Are the action scenes more interesting than the urban disasters featured in most recent superhero movies? And is the Falcon really Cap\xe2\x80\x99s only friend outside SHIELD? Also, we reveal the Hydra secret handshake. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with Tony Sindelar, Dan Moren, Guy English, Mois\xc3\xa9s Chiullan and Rene Ritchie.&lt;/p&gt;, Warm up your modem and turn your nuclear-launch key\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s time to play Global Thermonuclear War! We discuss \xe2\x80\x9cWarGames,\xe2\x80\x9d the 1983 John Badham film starring Matthew Broderick, Dabney Coleman, and Ally Sheedy. Is this the ultimate film for computer nerds like us? How do the film\xe2\x80\x99s Cold War themes contrast with its anti-technology themes? Can a computer make moral decisions? Why is there so much nerd shaming and sexism? And why do they let tour buses into the heart of America\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear command? So many questions, Professor Falken, and so few remote-controlled pterodactyls. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Greg Knauss, John Siracusa, Andy Ihnatko and David J. Loehr.&lt;/p&gt;, In the spirit of April Fool\xe2\x80\x99s Day, we present the second edition of The Incomparable Game Show. Two teams match up in a battle of trivia and pointlessness. (Or is that redundant?) &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell         with Glenn Fleishman, Greg Knauss, Steve Lutz, Monty Ashley, Erika Ensign, Scott McNulty, John Siracusa and Dan Moren.&lt;/p&gt;, Our Book Club reconvenes to discuss \xe2\x80\x9cThe Martian\xe2\x80\x9d by Andy Weir. It\xe2\x80\x99s a nuts-and-bolts adventure about a stranded astronaut who uses his botany and engineering skills to stay alive on Mars. Did we mention botany? And engineering? There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of both. Also, we tell you what we\xe2\x80\x99re reading. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Lisa Schmeiser, Lex Friedman, Scott McNulty and John Moltz.&lt;/p&gt;, We reconvene our Old Movie Club to watch two gritty early-1970s films that have been unfortunately remade in the last decade: \xe2\x80\x9cGet Carter\xe2\x80\x9d starring Michael Caine, and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Taking of Pelham One Two Three\xe2\x80\x9d starring Walter Matthau. We learn about slide-based pornography, metaphors involving stick-shift cars, angry New York transit officers, kazoo parades, and so much more. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Steve Lutz, David J. Loehr and Philip Michaels.&lt;/p&gt;, It was the dawn of a new age\xe2\x80\x94the rise of sci-fi shows with story arcs, complex characters, and computer-based special effects. \xe2\x80\x9cBabylon 5\xe2\x80\x9d was a trailblazing TV series and we give it the treatment it deserves in this double-sized episode. The curious can join us for a lengthy pre-Spoiler Horn conversation about why we like the show, and the veterans can stick around for detailed, spoilery conversations about where the show went during its five seasons on the air. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Erika Ensign, Michael Gartenberg, Chip Sudderth and Andy Ihnatko.&lt;/p&gt;, Do you love cardboard and hate sanity? Then join us for our draft of favorite board games! We do some uranium mining on a donkey, propose a new trivia-themed podcast, debate the merits of Sanka versus Yuban, and discuss two different versions of Risk\xe2\x80\x94three, if you count the version Tony invented where each Risk battle is settled by a full game of Monopoly. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with Dan Moren, David J. Loehr, Monty Ashley, Erika Ensign and Tony Sindelar.&lt;/p&gt;, Do you like sand? Then you may get upset as we conclude our discussion of \xe2\x80\x9cStar Wars: Episode II \xe2\x80\x94 Attack of the Clones,\xe2\x80\x9d in which we ponder the mystery of droid consciousness, fail to get excited about seeing our old friends from Episode I again, open a Variety Pack of monsters, debate Yoda\xe2\x80\x99s fighting strategy, and talk John Siracusa off the ledge. Finally, we ponder whether it\xe2\x80\x99s worse for a movie to be bad or boring. (Part 2 of 2.) &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with Dan Moren, John Siracusa, Monty Ashley, Serenity Caldwell and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;, Against the advice of our doctors, we\xe2\x80\x99re back with more prequels. This time it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cStar Wars: Episode II \xe2\x80\x94 Attack of the Clones.\xe2\x80\x9d With three different opening statements, our podcast is about as bureaucratic as the Imperial Senate. We also discuss R2\xe2\x80\x99s incompetence as a security system, ponder Anakin\xe2\x80\x99s puzzling pick-up lines (and haircut), sympathize with the boring job of the Jedi, and question the plight of the Fett family and the clone troopers. (Part 1 of 2.) &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with John Siracusa, Steve Lutz, Serenity Caldwell, Dan Moren and Monty Ashley.&lt;/p&gt;, Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones, but will he always be? We discuss the interesting problem of replacing the face of your franchise, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s Doctor Who or James Bond or Captain Kirk or Batman or Superman. Fortunately, we leave plenty of time for digressions into old TV shows (including \xe2\x80\x9cThree\xe2\x80\x99s Company,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBewitched,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cMagnum P.I.\xe2\x80\x9d) and anger the internet\xe2\x80\x99s foremost Robocopians. Spoiler: In the end, Hollywood ruins everything. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Jason Brightman, Andy Ihnatko, Erika Ensign and David J. Loehr.&lt;/p&gt;, Unlock the front door to your mind palace, fake your death in numerous ways, and draw on a fake mustache! Season 3 of \xe2\x80\x9cSherlock\xe2\x80\x9d is on our agenda, and we discuss all three episodes in turn. How does the introduction of Mary improve the cast dynamic? Does the middle episode sag as in past seasons, or prove to be a highlight? The game is on, Watson. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell       with John Siracusa, Erika Ensign, Dan Moren, David J. Loehr, Serenity Caldwell and Mois\xc3\xa9s Chiullan.&lt;/p&gt;, Our book club returns with discussion of two books! First we talk Scott Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lies of Locke Lamora,\xe2\x80\x9d a fantasy book about a gang of thieves that are even outlaws to other thieves (spoiler horn at 12:00). Then it\xe2\x80\x99s Ann Leckie\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cAncillary Justice,\xe2\x80\x9d a space opera about AIs and ships and empires and corpse soldiers that brings Iain M. Banks to mind (starts at 28:48, spoilers at 33:22). Confusingly long prologues! Fun with gendered pronouns! Questionable burrito metaphors! Plus: What are we reading (starts at 68:13)? &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Moren, Scott McNulty and Monty Ashley.&lt;/p&gt;, We continue selecting our favorite all-time console video games. John chooses the classics. Steve has a bad fur day. And Mois\xc3\xa9s continues his descent into madness. Boop beep beep boop! (Part 2 of 2) &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with Mois\xc3\xa9s Chiullan, Steve Lutz, Tony Sindelar, John Siracusa and Greg Knauss.&lt;/p&gt;, It\xe2\x80\x99s time for us to select some of the very best console video games of all time. From Mario to Zelda, from sports to music, from Atari to Intellivision, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the entire history of the video-game industry covered. Are you a bad enough dude to listen? (Part 1 of 2) &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with Greg Knauss, John Siracusa, Mois\xc3\xa9s Chiullan, Steve Lutz and Tony Sindelar.&lt;/p&gt;, We say goodbye to 2013 by listing our favorite stuff from the past year. We also recall our favorite podcast moments and read a whole bunch of listener comments. (This is a new episode, though it does contain a few classic Incomparable clips from 2013 and earlier.) &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell         with Dan Moren, Erika Ensign, Greg Knauss, John Siracusa, Steve Lutz, Tony Sindelar, Scott McNulty and David J. Loehr.&lt;/p&gt;, \xe2\x80\x9cDoctor Who\xe2\x80\x9d said farewell to Eleventh Doctor Matt Smith on Christmas Day. In an Incomparable Christmas tradition, we convened almost immediately after the airing of the episode to discuss \xe2\x80\x9cThe Time of the Doctor\xe2\x80\x9d in great detail in an unedited live flashcast. Cyberman-head companions! A turkey that takes 300 years to cook in the vortex! Lots of past plot boxes checked! A teary farewell and regeneration! Kidneys of a dubious color! We break it all down. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with Dan Moren, David J. Loehr, Glenn Fleishman, Scott McNulty and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, The Incomparable Radio Theater of the Air wishes a Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell                with Andy Ihnatko, David J. Loehr, Erika Ensign, Glenn Fleishman, John Siracusa, Lex Friedman, Lisa Schmeiser, Mois\xc3\xa9s Chiullan, Monty Ashley, Philip Michaels, Scott McNulty, Serenity Caldwell, Steve Lutz, Tony Sindelar and Merlin Mann.&lt;/p&gt;, \xe2\x80\x98Tis the season for holiday music! Unfortunately, while we unabashedly love the holidays, only some holiday music strikes our fancy. Join us as we talk about what makes a good holiday song and then stick around (if you dare) as we complain about some of the worst the season has to offer. Happy holidays, folks! &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell       with David J. Loehr, Erika Ensign, Lisa Schmeiser, Philip Michaels, Monty Ashley and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;, Holiday TV: There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of it, and some of it is good. A lot of it is bad. We talk about classics great and not-so-great and induct some very special shows into the Incomparable Holiday Vault. Also, Steve reveals a deep, dark secret. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with David J. Loehr, Monty Ashley and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;, Winter\xe2\x80\x99s here and it\xe2\x80\x99s time to light a fire, get under a blanket, and curl up with a good book. Our panelists are well read and of exquisite taste, so we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a boatload of suggestions for you. From funny to serious, there\xe2\x80\x99s a book in our list that will hit the spot the next time you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for something to read. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with David J. Loehr, Erika Ensign, Glenn Fleishman, Lisa Schmeiser and Scott McNulty.&lt;/p&gt;, In this special unedited flashcast edition, we talk about the 50th Anniversary episode of Doctor Who, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Day of the Doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d immediately after viewing it! It just about made our heads explode and we want to watch it again immediately. Join us for our post-episode breakdown of what we saw and what we liked. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Serenity Caldwell, Dan Moren, David J. Loehr and Scott McNulty.&lt;/p&gt;, 50 years ago some very clever people invented \xe2\x80\x9cDoctor Who.\xe2\x80\x9d 50 years later we still love it. On the occasion of the show\xe2\x80\x99s golden anniversary, here\xe2\x80\x99s our unabashed lovefest for the BBC\xe2\x80\x99s most clever invention. Four American fans discuss how we discovered the show, our favorite Doctors and stories, and the unique and welcoming culture of sci-fi fandom. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Erika Ensign, Chip Sudderth and Glenn Fleishman.&lt;/p&gt;, Pick up the clicker and join us for our conversation about the new TV season. We talk ABC\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cMarvel\xe2\x80\x99s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cSleepy Hollow,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Blacklist,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBrooklyn Nine-Nine,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Crazy Ones,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Michael J. Fox Show,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMasters of Sex,\xe2\x80\x9d and also NBC\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cDracula\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which we haven\xe2\x80\x99t actually seen. Plus returning shows of note like \xe2\x80\x9cParks and Recreation,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBob\xe2\x80\x99s Burgers,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHow I Met Your Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Big Bang Theory.\xe2\x80\x9d We also talk about how exciting corporate synergy can be, Scott endorses a show you should watch if you have the channel it\xe2\x80\x99s on, and we provide our pitch for \xe2\x80\x9cCSI: Dracula.\xe2\x80\x9d &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Andy Ihnatko, Dan Moren, David J. Loehr and Scott McNulty.&lt;/p&gt;, Old Movie Club returns! We look at three films from 1952: \xe2\x80\x9cSingin\xe2\x80\x99 in the Rain,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHigh Noon,\xe2\x80\x9d and Best Picture winner (!) \xe2\x80\x9cThe Greatest Show on Earth.\xe2\x80\x9d One of these movies is not like the others. Plus: The haunting repetition of Tex Ritter! Charlton Heston\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to the circus! And Phil asks Jason what it feels like to have no soul! Travel back 61 years in time and join us, won\xe2\x80\x99t you? &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell       with Philip Michaels, Lisa Schmeiser, David J. Loehr, Erika Ensign, Steve Lutz and Monty Ashley.&lt;/p&gt;, Awful people can make great art. Nice people can write bad books. Can you separate the creator from the art? We struggle with Orson Scott Card and his (rightfully) classic novel \xe2\x80\x9cEnder\xe2\x80\x99s Game\xe2\x80\x9d and go on to list other writers and series who we\xe2\x80\x99ve hand to break up with. To make things not entirely disappointing, we also talk about authors and series that have never let us down. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Lisa Schmeiser, Scott McNulty, Dan Moren and David J. Loehr.&lt;/p&gt;, In this double-length episode we talk about two video games even non-gamers like Jason can enjoy, \xe2\x80\x9cGone Home\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cBrothers.\xe2\x80\x9d We ponder what makes a game challenging, and if a game must be challenging to be good. John likes both games, but has a list of grievances. All disagreements will be settled with a duel of \xe2\x80\x9980s mixtapes at dawn! Plus: What other games are we playing? &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Dan Moren, John Siracusa, Tony Sindelar and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;, Grab a pint and marinate your brain as we discuss the \xe2\x80\x9cCornetto Trilogy,\xe2\x80\x9d three films by Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright that are linked in theme if not in characters: \xe2\x80\x9cShaun of the Dead,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHot Fuzz,\xe2\x80\x9d and recent release \xe2\x80\x9cThe World\xe2\x80\x99s End.\xe2\x80\x9d Why aren\xe2\x80\x99t there more smart genre comedies? How do Pegg and Wright so deftly handle different genres? How are these movies like the Commedia dell\xe2\x80\x99arte? Why do Jason and Jeff want to punch Nick Frost, then hug him? Plus, we give even more Incomparable love to \xe2\x80\x9cSpaced.\xe2\x80\x9d &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Dan Moren, Serenity Caldwell, David J. Loehr and Jeff Carlson.&lt;/p&gt;, The winner of our iTunes review contest had us read John Birmingham\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cWeapons of Choice,\xe2\x80\x9d which our Book Club used as a jumping-off point to talk about alt-history novels, time travel, military SF, and a whole lot more. You don\xe2\x80\x99t need to read the book to appreciate the episode! Plus: What are we reading? &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell   with David J. Loehr and Scott McNulty.&lt;/p&gt;, Live! From a (somewhat echoey, sorry) room in Portland Oregon, we talk about the exciting new world of Internet-aided content creation. How have sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo and even Amazon changed how people create and consume books, movies, TV shows, and music? And what\xe2\x80\x99s the missing piece of this content revolution? &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Glenn Fleishman, Greg Knauss and Jeff Carlson.&lt;/p&gt;, Bonus episode! Here\xe2\x80\x99s an edited fourth installment of our Dungeons and Dragons campaign. Our heroes have made it inside a strange desert temple and have mostly not died\xe2\x80\xa6 yet. But the night is young and the basins in this temple are full of an unknown magical fluid, so anything could happen! &lt;p&gt;Host Scott McNulty      with Dan Moren, Jason Snell, Serenity Caldwell, Steve Lutz and Tony Sindelar.&lt;/p&gt;, Take the red pill and enter \xe2\x80\x9cThe Matrix,\xe2\x80\x9d 1999\xe2\x80\x99s influential sci-fi/action classic. Why does Morpheus talk like a fortune cookie? Is Keanu\xe2\x80\x99s woodenness an asset or detriment? Was skeuomorphism the fall of man? And if we accept that living things can be used as batteries, why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the machines just use cows? Grad students, we are about to blow your minds. Whoa. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with David J. Loehr, John Siracusa, Steve Lutz and Erika Ensign.&lt;/p&gt;, We conclude the second Incomparable Film Festival with 21 more films we think are worth seeing, in fantasy draft format. Don\xe2\x80\x99t miss the exciting Lightning Round, and stay tuned when it\xe2\x80\x99s all over for our expert post-draft analysis! (Part 2 of 2.) &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell        with Dan Moren, David J. Loehr, Monty Ashley, Steve Lutz, Andy Ihnatko, John Siracusa and Philip Michaels.&lt;/p&gt;, It\xe2\x80\x99s time for the second Incomparable Film Festival! We pick 35 films that we think are worth seeing, in fantasy draft format. From horror to comedy to drama to sci-fi to kung-fu, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got just about every genre covered. (Part 1 of 2.) &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell       with Andy Ihnatko, Dan Moren, David J. Loehr, John Siracusa, Monty Ashley and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;, An entire comic book about Hawkeye, the lesser Marvel superhero with a bow and arrow? Okay\xe2\x80\xa6 this looks bad. But seriously, bro, this is one of the very best comics being published today. We cover the first two trade-paperback editions of Fraction and Aja\xe2\x80\x99s series, including Lucky the Pizza Dog, 50 Shades of Purple, and how hooking up a laserdisc player is similar to defusing a bomb. Hop on board and join us\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99re great at boats. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Dan Moren, Lisa Schmeiser, Merlin Mann and Tony Sindelar.&lt;/p&gt;, Special guest star Philip Michaels gives us an old-movie education with two caper movies from the 1950s, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lavender Hill Mob\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Killing.\xe2\x80\x9d One\xe2\x80\x99s funny, one\xe2\x80\x99s not, but both teach us that crime doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pay! Plus young Stanley Kubrick, funnyman Alec Guinness, the second-greatest fight scene Steve has ever seen, and a guest appearance by General Eisenhower. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Dan Moren, David J. Loehr, Steve Lutz and Philip Michaels.&lt;/p&gt;, A boy with no name travels to the end of the lane and discovers how a pond can be an ocean in Neil Gaiman\xe2\x80\x99s brief and wonderful novel \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ocean at the End of the Lane.\xe2\x80\x9d Also Dan explains Jason\xe2\x80\x99s perfect vacation, there\xe2\x80\x99s lots of talk about cats, why David has issues with Old Yeller, and we talk about other Neil Gaiman works that we like. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell   with Dan Moren and David J. Loehr.&lt;/p&gt;, Do you like stories, love, and life? Then even if you\xe2\x80\x99re not a regular comic book reader, you should read \xe2\x80\x9cSaga,\xe2\x80\x9d by Brian K. Vaughan and Fiona Staples. (Unless naked robot sex disturbs you, in which case you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.) We cover the horns and the wings, bad connections on the interstellar cellphone network, seahorse agents, super space high school, a frog with a banjo, the wisdom of hiring a ghost as your babysitter, and much more. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Merlin Mann, Dan Moren and Tony Sindelar.&lt;/p&gt;, Load your shotgun, put on your clear plastic suit, and climb into that suspiciously humming box! We\xe2\x80\x99re here to talk about three very different time-travel movies: \xe2\x80\x9c12 Monkeys,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cLooper,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cPrimer.\xe2\x80\x9d Is \xe2\x80\x9cCrazy Brad Pitt\xe2\x80\x9d a thing? If you met a younger version of yourself, would you fight or cuddle? Why is the apocalypse like Philadelphia? Also something about a Weeble in a time machine, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t really understand that part. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with John Siracusa, Lex Friedman, Monty Ashley, David J. Loehr and Tony Sindelar.&lt;/p&gt;, Live! From San Diego County! It\xe2\x80\x99s a podcast where Jason Snell, Steve Lutz, and Greg Knauss drink beer and talk about Comic-Con, a glut of too much good media, the pros and cons of wearing costumes, Adventure Time, Glenn\xe2\x80\x99s health scare, and much more. It\xe2\x80\x99s slightly tipsy and more than slightly rambling, but we hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll crack a beverage of your own and join us for this cocktail party.   &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell   with Steve Lutz and Greg Knauss.&lt;/p&gt;, Put on your red shirt, renew your blogging license, and swallow some alien bacteria! It\xe2\x80\x99s time for our annual read of the five Hugo Award nominees for best novel. We liked some of them, we hated some of them, but we talked about all of them! But beware: The diabolical eyes of the Centers for Disease Control are watching us all. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman, Monty Ashley and Scott McNulty.&lt;/p&gt;, It\xe2\x80\x99s our 150th episode! Since we don\xe2\x80\x99t normally answer listener questions and read comments on the show, we\xe2\x80\x99re devoting this episode to that very topic. We read your emails, your iTunes reviews, and your tweets, and announce a contest that will let one lucky listener choose the topic of a future episode. Are we too critical or not critical enough? Do we disagree too much or not enough? Plus: Why we\xe2\x80\x99re not kidnapping Stephen Fry, a new magazine for apes, light eatage, and some Glenning. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell       with Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman, John Siracusa, Scott McNulty, Steve Lutz and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, The Incomparable\xe2\x80\x99s Superhero Draft is now in session, and justice is on the clock! Hear our collection of panelists assemble several excellent super-teams. Who will inhabit the Hall of Justice? And why are Superman and Batman looking on forlornly? Are they just not team players? Take your Sharknado to the Evil Museum and ponder just why Iron Man might not be the hero you think he is. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with Dan Moren, Lisa Schmeiser, Monty Ashley, Steve Lutz and Scott McNulty.&lt;/p&gt;, Jason\xe2\x80\x99s on vacation this week, so instead of a conventional episode, here\xe2\x80\x99s an edited third installment of our Dungeons and Dragons campaign. Hot on the heels of the death of Eglath, our heroes step into the maelstrom and discover the secret of the stone temple on the other side. Also, is that a lobster? And who is that guy wearing a hat? &lt;p&gt;Host Scott McNulty      with Jason Snell, Dan Moren, Steve Lutz, Serenity Caldwell and Tony Sindelar.&lt;/p&gt;, Though we were tempted to release this episode in eight 10-minute installments, we refrained. Our Book Club reconvenes to discuss John Scalzi\xe2\x80\x99s novel \xe2\x80\x9cThe Human Division,\xe2\x80\x9d which was initially released as a serial and later as a single-volume novel. Does the serialized format help or hurt? Is Scalzi\xe2\x80\x99s return to his \xe2\x80\x9cOld Man\xe2\x80\x99s War\xe2\x80\x9d universe a triumph? PLUS! We discuss all the short fiction nominated for the Hugo Award this year. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman and Scott McNulty.&lt;/p&gt;, Quick! Before the planet is destroyed! Climb on your Kryptonian dragonfly-horse thing and join us to discuss \xe2\x80\x9cMan of Steel,\xe2\x80\x9d the first in a new cycle of Superman movies. We debate the talents of director Zack Snyder, question the movie artistically and as a calculated act of commerce, praise a lot of very good things about the movie, and complain a whole lot about gleeful destruction and the accompanying property damage. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Moren, John Siracusa and Mois\xc3\xa9s Chiullan.&lt;/p&gt;, Winter is coming! Any day now. No, really\xe2\x80\xa6 Wait for it\xe2\x80\xa6 Hmm. In the meantime, here\xe2\x80\x99s our review of this year\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cGame of Thrones\xe2\x80\x9d season, recorded with all of us in the same room! Haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen it? Skip ahead an hour and listen to us talk about other TV shows we watched during the 2012-2013 TV season, including the finale of \xe2\x80\x9cFringe.\xe2\x80\x9d &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Moren, John Siracusa and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, \xe2\x80\x9cMy Neighbor Totoro\xe2\x80\x9d is an animated classic in which nothing much happens, but we love it anyway. We discuss how the movie is all about children\xe2\x80\x99s fears of change, ponder the differences between subtitled and dubbed versions, and contemplate corn as a cure for tuberculosis. CREEPY! &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with John Siracusa, Steve Lutz and Merlin Mann.&lt;/p&gt;, Press down on the warp lever and hide away your out-of-date continuity reference materials. It\xe2\x80\x99s time for us to discuss J.J. Abrams\xe2\x80\x99 reimagined Star Trek, with an emphasis on the new film \xe2\x80\x9cStar Trek Into Darkness.\xe2\x80\x9d Among our topics: The great casting in both movies, the merits of a Spock-to-Spock Skype call, McCoy\xe2\x80\x99s Tribble-based scientific method, and the themes of self-sacrifice in the new movie. Plus we reference every single classic Star Trek movie along the way! And yes, there are spoilers. Lots and lots of spoilers. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Dan Moren, John Siracusa, Scott McNulty and David J. Loehr.&lt;/p&gt;, From aliens in the wi-fi to a brain leech under a hat, from some bad nannying to a trio of idiots with a really big space magnet, it\xe2\x80\x99s been an odd half-season for our favorite Time Lord. Here\xe2\x80\x99s our recap of the second half of series 7 of \xe2\x80\x9cDoctor Who.\xe2\x80\x9d Plus: The Spoiler Horn makes it safe for everyone who wanted to learn the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s real name. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Chip Sudderth, John Siracusa, Dan Moren and Scott McNulty.&lt;/p&gt;, Put on your high-tech suit of armor and join us for our discussion of \xe2\x80\x9cIron Man 3.\xe2\x80\x9d We talk about Tony\xe2\x80\x99s post-traumatic stress, his problematic relationship with technology, and his questionable choice to use remote armor to give a present to his girlfriend. We also discuss the pros and cons of the first two Iron Man movies, analyze how this film fits in as a post-\xe2\x80\x9cAvengers\xe2\x80\x9d story, and appreciate Tony\xe2\x80\x99s MacGyver moment. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Lisa Schmeiser, Scott McNulty and Guy English.&lt;/p&gt;, No more mutants! We discuss the 2005 Marvel Comics miniseries \xe2\x80\x9cHouse of M,\xe2\x80\x9d in which writer Brian Michael Bendis gets to show off his love of meetings, Doctor Strange, and meetings chaired by Doctor Strange! Also, there\xe2\x80\x99s a crazy \xe2\x80\x9cWhat If?\xe2\x80\x9d style parallel universe, approximately a billion spin-offs, and in the cruelest twist, Peter Parker is briefly allowed to be happy. And finally there\xe2\x80\x99s a shocking finale that set the tone for mutant storylines up to the present day. Listen before the Scarlet Witch wishes this podcast out of existence! &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Lisa Schmeiser, Merlin Mann, Andy Ihnatko and Mois\xc3\xa9s Chiullan.&lt;/p&gt;, We delve into the children\xe2\x80\x99s literary classic \xe2\x80\x9cA Wrinkle In Time,\xe2\x80\x9d by Madeline L\xe2\x80\x99Engle, as well as its recent graphic-novel adaptation by Hope Larson. Why is there a brain on that table? What are the pros and cons of cooking dinner on a Bunsen burner for the average Super-Cool Science Family? Come for the Cold War allegories about communism, stay to talk religion with a bunch of nerds! &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Lisa Schmeiser, Serenity Caldwell and David J. Loehr.&lt;/p&gt;, Bonus episode! Here\xe2\x80\x99s the (warning: UNEDITED) result of our second Dungeons and Dragons session. After some dithering in the local vicinity, we venture out into the desert to meet glass spiders and some really unpleasant green guys. &lt;p&gt;Host Scott McNulty      with Jason Snell, Dan Moren, Serenity Caldwell, Tony Sindelar and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;, We conclude our discussion of \xe2\x80\x9cStar Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace.\xe2\x80\x9d We discuss the merits of podracing, debate who the Jedi\xe2\x80\x99s version of Fonzie is, and grapple with tricky euphemisms. Plus, is the final lightsaber duel cool or just over-choreographed? And why is there a hall full of forcefields, next to a room with no guard rails? Party on, Darth! (Part 2 of 2.) &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell       with Dan Moren, Greg Knauss, John Siracusa, Serenity Caldwell, Steve Lutz and Monty Ashley.&lt;/p&gt;, They said it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be done! They said it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be done! But here we are, talking about \xe2\x80\x9cStar Wars: Episode I \xe2\x80\x94 The Phantom Menace.\xe2\x80\x9d Why are the Jedi such jerks? A little Jedi goes a long way. Also, the biggest letdown of John Siracusa\xe2\x80\x99s life to date, stupid droids, good actors being boring, text versus subtext, the merits of prequels in general, and why this is a movie that makes us dream\xe2\x80\xa6 of a better movie. Exqueeze me? (Part 1 of 2.) &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell       with Dan Moren, Greg Knauss, John Siracusa, Monty Ashley, Serenity Caldwell and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;, Get out your 20-sided dice and join us in a game of Dungeons and Dragons. Scott McNulty is our DM. Jason, Ren, Dan, Steve, and Tony are our party. Things don\xe2\x80\x99t go well. &lt;p&gt;Host Scott McNulty      with Jason Snell, Dan Moren, Serenity Caldwell, Steve Lutz and Tony Sindelar.&lt;/p&gt;, Load your shotgun and gather your platonic apocalypse friends around you! It\xe2\x80\x99s time for us to discuss two books about the end of the world, Peter Heller\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe Dog Stars\xe2\x80\x9d and Cormac McCarthy\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe Road.\xe2\x80\x9d Do names matter when the world has ended? We also revisit John Siracusa\xe2\x80\x99s doomsday plans (a moat is involved), Lex offers a depressing death plan, Jason extolls the virtue of dirty apocalypses, and Scott laughs it up from his apartment full of canned food. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with John Siracusa, Scott McNulty and Lex Friedman.&lt;/p&gt;, How much do we love old-time radio dramas and full-cast audioplays? This much. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell              with David J. Loehr, Serenity Caldwell, Andy Ihnatko, Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman, John Siracusa, Lex Friedman, Lisa Schmeiser, Monty Ashley, Scott McNulty, Steve Lutz, Ben Boychuk and John Moltz.&lt;/p&gt;, Don\xe2\x80\x99t make us angry\xe2\x80\xa6 you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like us when we\xe2\x80\x99re angry. Our Comic Book Club talks all things Hulk. We begin with a discussion of two She-Hulk series, by John Byrne and Dan Slott, and then move to talk about Proper Hulk, Gray Hulk, Red Hulk, Planet Hulk, Ruffalo Hulk, and more! Plus: What are we reading? (Jason gets really excited about \xe2\x80\x9cHawkeye,\xe2\x80\x9d who is not a Hulk.) And, other than being green, how is the Hulk like parsley? Channel your inner rage and listen to this episode. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell   with Lisa Schmeiser and Jason Brightman.&lt;/p&gt;, John Siracusa assigns us two animated films from director Satoshi Kon, \xe2\x80\x9cPerfect Blue\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cMillennium Actress.\xe2\x80\x9d Then we watch them! Featuring: What to look for in Anime tropes, blurring of reality and fantasy, when animation is better than live action, and the lovingly rendered start-up sequence of a Macintosh Performa. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with John Siracusa, Lisa Schmeiser and Tony Sindelar.&lt;/p&gt;, Disconnect the intelligent computer that runs your entire planetary society, because it\xe2\x80\x99s time for the second half of our discussion of the original \xe2\x80\x9cStar Trek.\xe2\x80\x9d What do today\xe2\x80\x99s kids think of this nearly 50-year-old show? We ponder the gender politics of splitting Captain Kirk (and a little dog in a weird costume) into good and evil halves. And what about the low standards of the Enterprise\xe2\x80\x99s Engineering department? Please listen: It will only take 71 of your Earth minutes! (Part 2 of 2.) &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Scott McNulty, Steve Lutz and Tony Sindelar.&lt;/p&gt;, Lay in a course and set your phaser to stun! We discuss our favorite (and least favorite) episodes of the original \xe2\x80\x9cStar Trek\xe2\x80\x9d series. Was Dr. McCoy promoting vegetarianism? Why did Spock have such a lovely collection of hats? What does Bob Barker have to do with the Guardian of Forever? Join us as we boldly go where so many have gone before. (Part 1 of 2.) &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Scott McNulty, Steve Lutz and Tony Sindelar.&lt;/p&gt;, Cut off your thumb and send it to a friend just to see what grows! In this episode of our Book Club, we talk about Daniel O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s modern supernatural fantasy novel, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Rook.\xe2\x80\x9d (We liked it a lot!) It\xe2\x80\x99s sort of about a supernatural version of Britain\xe2\x80\x99s MI-5, written by an American-educated Australian civil servant. Also: What are Scott, Dan, and Jason reading? &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell   with Dan Moren and Scott McNulty.&lt;/p&gt;, We convened on the Macworld Live stage at Macworld/iWorld 2013 to discuss the works of Aaron Sorkin. From \xe2\x80\x9cThe West Wing\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cSports Night,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe American President\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cThe Social Network,\xe2\x80\x9d it\xe2\x80\x99s all here. &lt;p&gt;Host Dan Moren     with Dan Frakes, Lex Friedman, Serenity Caldwell and Jeff Carlson.&lt;/p&gt;, Get out your magical key ring and prepare for our discussion of \xe2\x80\x9cLocke and Key\xe2\x80\x9d by Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodriguez. It\xe2\x80\x99s a dark fantasy/horror comic with some touches of Stephen King, fitting since Joe Hill is Stephen King\xe2\x80\x99s kid! It\xe2\x80\x99s also really good. We drop some mild spoilers for Vol. 1, \xe2\x80\x9cWelcome to Lovecraft,\xe2\x80\x9d which you should go buy right now. Plus: What comics are we reading? &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Lisa Schmeiser, Jason Brightman and Mois\xc3\xa9s Chiullan.&lt;/p&gt;, Our fellowship is sundered, as we wrap up our look at the \xe2\x80\x9cLord of the Rings\xe2\x80\x9d movies with a discussion of our favorite (and some least-favorite) performances. Also, is Yoda better than Gollum? Who likes Orcs, anyway? Why does Liv Tyler make Jason want to go to the bathroom? And there are many, many endings. (Part 2 of 2.) &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Andy Ihnatko, Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman and John Siracusa.&lt;/p&gt;, It\xe2\x80\x99s a two-part podcast about a three-part movie series spread across six discs based on a novel divided into three parts! We tackle Peter Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLord of the Rings\xe2\x80\x9d trilogy, from its epic length to the perils of adapting such rich source material. Plus a spotter\xe2\x80\x99s guide to differentiating between Dwarfy, Elfy, Beardy, and Hobbits One through Four. And Glenn proves that he knows Elvish. The road goes ever on, and on, and on\xe2\x80\xa6 (Part 1 of 2.) &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Andy Ihnatko, Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman and John Siracusa.&lt;/p&gt;, Insert a quarter and settle back to listen to us discuss the Oscar-nominated animated feature \xe2\x80\x9cWreck-It Ralph,\xe2\x80\x9d which is inspired by classic video games. If you make it past the first level, you\xe2\x80\x99ll also hear us discuss some of the video games our collection of elderly gentleman played when they were children back in the \xe2\x80\x9970s and \xe2\x80\x9980s. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t make it that far, keep trying\xe2\x80\x94the change machine\xe2\x80\x99s right over there. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with Dan Frakes, Glenn Fleishman, John Siracusa, Monty Ashley and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;, We say goodbye to 2012 by listing our favorite stuff from the past year. We also recall our favorite podcast moments, read a whole bunch of listener comments, and celebrate the three brand-new words we popularized this year. (This is a new episode, though it does contain a few classic Incomparable clips from 2012\xe2\x80\x94and beyond.) &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell        with Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman, John Siracusa, Lisa Schmeiser, Scott McNulty, Serenity Caldwell and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;, A live \xe2\x80\x9cflash\xe2\x80\x9d episode recorded right after we watched the 2012 \xe2\x80\x9cDoctor Who\xe2\x80\x9d Christmas special, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Snowmen.\xe2\x80\x9d We welcome (back?) Jenna-Louise Coleman and discuss whether this new start for the Doctor has rekindled our enthusiasm for the show. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Moren, Scott McNulty and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, Showing remarkable optimism, we gathered on the eve of the Mayan apocalypse to discuss movies we might see in 2013. In this episode, we discuss the trailers for much-anticipated films \xe2\x80\x9cStar Trek Into Darkness\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cMan of Steel\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cPacific Rim\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cOblivion\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cAfter Earth\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lone Ranger\xe2\x80\x9d, and \xe2\x80\x9cUpstream Color.\xe2\x80\x9d Also: Robot Thursdays, the merits of Star Trek punctuation, a Bolivian, Ethan Hunt versus the Fresh Prince, and traditional Kryptonian formalwear. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Dan Moren, John Siracusa, Scott McNulty and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;, With great power comes the responsibility to book great guests. And so when it came time to discuss \xe2\x80\x9cThe Amazing Spider-Man\xe2\x80\x9d and Spidey in general, Jason turned to reknowned spider-fans Andy Ihnatko and Dan Benjamin. We discuss how the Spidey in the new movie is a different sort of guilt-trip superhero. Dan explains why you can\xe2\x80\x99t actually kill a spider. Andy previews his new comic book, The Indigestible Spider-Man. We touch on the changes in Ultimate Spider-Man and speculate about the soon-to-arrive Amazing Spider-Man #700. Jason sings two different Spidey theme songs and does his J. Jonah Jameson impression. This giant-sized episode is more Spidey than you can shake a web at. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell   with Andy Ihnatko and Dan Benjamin.&lt;/p&gt;, Trim the tree, wrap the presents, and watch out for the killer in your attic! It\xe2\x80\x99s time for us to place five new gems into the Incomparable Holiday Vault! We discuss some beloved holiday classics and offer a few surprise choices. This is a darker installment, as we uncover the racism in some holiday staples, and then Steve inducts a horror movie. And can a talk show really be a holiday special? You\xe2\x80\x99re gonna shoot your eye out with that thing! &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with Andy Ihnatko, Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman, Lisa Schmeiser and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;, We follow up on our previous episode to ask Serenity Caldwell how she uses her iPhone to read books (and discover her shocking method of scanning pages). Then there\xe2\x80\x99s a discussion of Lois McMaster Bujold\xe2\x80\x99s latest Vorkosigan novel, \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Vorpatril\xe2\x80\x99s Alliance.\xe2\x80\x9d Finally (at 65 minutes in if you\xe2\x80\x99re skipping ahead), Jason asks Scott to recommend which unread book on his Kindle he should dive into next. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Moren, Scott McNulty and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, We talk a lot about what we read, but how do we read? Join our Book Club as we talk about ebooks, paper books, and libraries, and how we like to read today. Plus, we tell you some of the books we\xe2\x80\x99re reading right now. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Moren, Lex Friedman and Scott McNulty.&lt;/p&gt;, Turn on your electrical generators, fire your nuclear missiles, and notch your bow and arrow\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s time for our review of the fall TV season, including both new and returning shows. We discuss \xe2\x80\x9cRevolution,\xe2\x80\x9d the since-cancelled \xe2\x80\x9cLast Resort,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cArrow,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cElementary,\xe2\x80\x9d and returning shows \xe2\x80\x9cFringe,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Walking Dead,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBoardwalk Empire,\xe2\x80\x9d and many others! &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Andy Ihnatko, Dan Moren, John Siracusa and Scott McNulty.&lt;/p&gt;, Were we pranked, or did Disney really just buy Lucasfilm and announce a new Star Wars trilogy? We decided to just assume it\xe2\x80\x99s happening and record a live flash podcast about this unexpected turn of events. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Ben Boychuk, Dan Moren, John Siracusa and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, We discuss the Indiana Jones movie series, including a brief revisitation of \xe2\x80\x9cRaiders of the Lost Ark,\xe2\x80\x9d the good parts of \xe2\x80\x9cTemple of Doom,\xe2\x80\x9d Dan\xe2\x80\x99s childhood love for \xe2\x80\x9cLast Crusade,\xe2\x80\x9d and utter denial about \xe2\x80\x9cKingdom of the Crystal Skull.\xe2\x80\x9d Also, Lex hasn\xe2\x80\x99t seen it. Recorded live at Cingleton Symposium, Montreal, October 2012. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Moren, Lex Friedman and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, Our very own Glenn Fleishman\xe2\x80\x99s was on \xe2\x80\x9cJeopardy!\xe2\x80\x9d We debriefed him about his adventures immediately on his return. In this episode, Jason and Glenn are also joined by Andy Ihnatko and Steve Lutz, and we talk about game shows and their modern reality-competition show equivalents, as well as harken back to the heyday of the panel show, where drunk celebrities engaged in witty repartee. It\xe2\x80\x99s an episode so comfy you\xe2\x80\x99ll feel like you were back in the womb at Bill Cullen\xe2\x80\x99s house. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Andy Ihnatko, Glenn Fleishman and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;, Rob Reiner\xe2\x80\x99s legendary heavy-metal mockumentary \xe2\x80\x9cThis is Spinal Tap\xe2\x80\x9d is in our sights. This is one of our very favorite films, and so Jason, Andy Ihnatko, and Ben Boychuk talk about why they love it while regaling one another with favorite lines from this amazingly quotable movie. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell   with Andy Ihnatko and Ben Boychuk.&lt;/p&gt;, Robot sheriff, coming through! We break down the first half of \xe2\x80\x9cDoctor Who\xe2\x80\x9d season 7, and discover the truth about the Siracusa Threshold. Today we are all John Siracusa, except for Scott. He\xe2\x80\x99s our Rory. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman, John Siracusa and Scott McNulty.&lt;/p&gt;, Soon to be a major motion picture you probably shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see, David Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s 2004 novel \xe2\x80\x9cCloud Atlas\xe2\x80\x9d is in our sights. This novel consists of six separate stories set in different genres and timeframes from the 1850s to a post-apocalyptic future, and yet they\xe2\x80\x99re all interlinked. Somehow. It\xe2\x80\x99s fun, weird, and challenging, but what does it all mean? Read it now before every character in it becomes Tom Hanks and Halle Berry. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell   with Scott McNulty and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;, A video game beloved by John Siracusa, \xe2\x80\x9cJourney\xe2\x80\x9d for the PS3, is in the spotlight. We toot the biggest Spoiler Horn of all time \xe2\x80\x94 don\xe2\x80\x99t listen if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t played it! \xe2\x80\x94 and then talk about what we liked and didn\xe2\x80\x99t like about Thatgamecompany\xe2\x80\x99s desert-and-spoiler epic. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with Dan Moren, Jason Tocci, Steve Lutz, John Siracusa and Tony Sindelar.&lt;/p&gt;, We take on one of our favorite movies, \xe2\x80\x9cStar Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,\xe2\x80\x9d while also acknowledging the flaws that make it all the more lovable. Topics include: How Genesis is the galaxy\xe2\x80\x99s worst Kickstarter project; Why it\xe2\x80\x99s always important to count the planets, especially at Ceti Alpha; The size of the Botany Bay library and why it makes Khan so mad at Kirk; Why Scott\xe2\x80\x99s email is more secure than the Reliant; The real name of Khan\xe2\x80\x99s right-hand man; and how Spock\xe2\x80\x99s death solves Kirk\xe2\x80\x99s mid-life crisis. Also, we scientifically prove that \xe2\x80\x9cWrath of Khan\xe2\x80\x9d is better than Star Wars. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Scott McNulty, Steve Lutz and Michael Gartenberg.&lt;/p&gt;, FLASH! A bonus (unedited) episode, in which we react quickly to the premiere episode of this season of Doctor Who, \xe2\x80\x9cAsylum of the Daleks.\xe2\x80\x9d Plus: The Incomparable won an award! For podcasting! We react quickly to the announcement of the Hugo Awards. And we do many, many Dalek impressions. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman, John Siracusa and Monty Ashley.&lt;/p&gt;, Our Book Club reconvenes to discuss Jo Walton\xe2\x80\x99s Small Change trilogy of novels, \xe2\x80\x9cFarthing,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHa\xe2\x80\x99Penny,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cHalf a Crown.\xe2\x80\x9d (We fire off the spoiler horn before each novel.) These novels explore an alternate-history in which Britain makes peace with Nazi Germany, and focus on a detective who just wants to do his job\xe2\x80\x94but his job keeps changing in increasingly awful ways. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman, Scott McNulty and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, Believe it or not, some of us have managed to breed successfully. Even Steve Lutz. So we talk about what media we provide for our kids. Topics include dealing with the Star Wars prequels, Spongebob Squarepants, how young you need to be to watch \xe2\x80\x9cApocalypse Now\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cThe Exorcist,\xe2\x80\x9d why \xe2\x80\x9cTron: Legacy\xe2\x80\x9d cost Ben dearly, why John became a master weaponsmith in his childhood, Jason\xe2\x80\x99s debates with his son over whether Spider-Man or Batman is better, Lisa\xe2\x80\x99s childhood reading of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Godfather,\xe2\x80\x9d picking video games for your kids, and how your children\xe2\x80\x99s peers will just ruin them anyway. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell       with Ben Boychuk, Dan Frakes, Glenn Fleishman, John Siracusa, Lisa Schmeiser and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;, Our Comic Book Club returns to discuss super-team comics. What makes them work, and what makes them fail? And our primary subject is Top 10, Alan Moore\xe2\x80\x99s other amazing twelve-issue superhero comic series. If you haven\xe2\x80\x99t read it yet, you should! (This week\xe2\x80\x99s panelists are Jason Brightman and Lisa Schmeiser.) &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell  with Lisa Schmeiser.&lt;/p&gt;, Pixar takes on princesses with the new film \xe2\x80\x9cBrave.\xe2\x80\x9d We discuss Pixar\xe2\x80\x99s mother/bear-daughter story, but also the larger issues of female characters in animation and film in general. What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with the Disney Princesses? Why can\xe2\x80\x99t girls play Belle or Ariel as if they were an action hero, anyway? How does Merida compare with the female protagonists in Miyazaki\xe2\x80\x99s work? Did Pixar change its own fate? &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Andy Ihnatko, Dan Frakes, John Siracusa and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, Our Book Club discusses \xe2\x80\x9cRedshirts\xe2\x80\x9d by John Scalzi. It\xe2\x80\x99s a book that\xe2\x80\x99s far more complex than its elevator-pitch premise would suggest, but did our panel appreciate its winking narrative-within-narrative structure? And more broadly, why are we worried about some of our favorite geek creators turning inward and pandering to the nerd audience? &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Glenn Fleishman, Scott McNulty and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, In our hundredth episode, we take a look at why we do The Incomparable. Can entertainment be appreciated without analysis and criticism? We also discuss how The Incomparable came to be, and pick some of our favorite (and least favorite) moments. Please forgive us for this self-indulgent meta-episode. We promise not to do another one until number 200. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell       with Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman, John Siracusa, Scott McNulty, Serenity Caldwell and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;, Summer\xe2\x80\x99s here and it\xe2\x80\x99s time to get to the beach with a good sci-fi novel. Our panelists are well read and of exquisite taste, so we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a boatload of suggestions for you. From funny to serious, there\xe2\x80\x99s a book in our list that will hit the spot the next time you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for something to read. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman, Lex Friedman, Scott McNulty and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, We tackle the works of Jonathan Coulton as our Geek Music Appreciation series continues. Join guest host Lex Friedman as he and our panelists build a JoCo playlist and discuss why Coulton has so much geek appeal. But just because Lex is guest-hosting doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that Jason Snell won\xe2\x80\x99t make a dramatic appearance at the end, so keep listening! &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with Greg Knauss, John Siracusa, Scott McNulty, Jonathan Coulton and Lex Friedman.&lt;/p&gt;, Good news, everyone! We\xe2\x80\x99re here to talk about the animated TV comedy \xe2\x80\x9cFuturama.\xe2\x80\x9d Join guest host Glenn Fleishman, special guest Andy Ihnatko, and virgin guests Jonathan Seff and Dean Putney as we discuss Bender, Fry, Dr. Zoidberg, and even Morbo. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell   with Glenn Fleishman and Andy Ihnatko.&lt;/p&gt;, The 2012 Hugo Award Nominees. Of all the sci-fi novels published in the last year, these are five of them! (And four aren\xe2\x80\x99t actually sci-fi.) But that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t stopped us from reading them and giving you our opinions. Join our book club as we talk about five books and pick our favorites. Plus: Vomit Zombies! A unique novel-sponsorship opportunity for Coca-Cola! Our near-unconditional love of author Jo Walton! And what the locusts are reading this year! &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Glenn Fleishman, Monty Ashley and Scott McNulty.&lt;/p&gt;, Unfurl your banners, steal some dragons, slap your insolent nephew, and get ready to listen to us discuss the second season of HBO\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cGame of Thrones\xe2\x80\x9d in this special live session. Plus, John explains the Internet to Jason. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Dan Moren, John Siracusa, Monty Ashley and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, We travel to where geekiness and comedy come together, to discuss our favorite geek TV comedies. From traditional sitcoms to animation to movie commentary, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got you covered. Plus there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of singing. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Andy Ihnatko, Dan Moren, Scott McNulty and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, Our book club takes a dive into the world of Paolo Bacigalupi, covering his award-winning novel \xe2\x80\x9cShip Breaker\xe2\x80\x9d as well as its recently-released follow-up, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Drowned Cities.\xe2\x80\x9d These books are apparently considered YA (or Young Adult) fiction, leading us to discuss what that label means, if anything. We also talk about Bacigalupi\xe2\x80\x99s particular brand of eco-apocalypse, his use of science fiction to make us reconsider what\xe2\x80\x99s going on today in the world, and how to pronounce his name. And of course, we coin a new word: it\xe2\x80\x99s half monster, half mentor, all Scott McNulty. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell   with Scott McNulty and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, Avengers assemble! We discuss Joss Whedon\xe2\x80\x99s Marvel movie, which has been a hit with audiences and critics. But some members of our panel don\xe2\x80\x99t agree. How much do expectations factor in to one\xe2\x80\x99s enjoyment of a movie? Has the bar for summer action blockbusters been set too low by the likes of \xe2\x80\x9cTransformers 2\xe2\x80\x9d? Should every action-adventure movie aspire to be something more? Why is this the first time that the Hulk has been portrayed properly in a film? Grab your cosmic cubes and prepare for 90 minutes of movie-smashing discussion. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Andy Ihnatko, Dan Moren, John Siracusa and Ben Boychuk.&lt;/p&gt;, From despotic rulers to lethal hummingbirds, it\xe2\x80\x99s time for us to address the cultural phenomenon of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Hunger Games.\xe2\x80\x9d Join us as we discuss the movie and original book, as well as (following carefully placed Spoiler Horns) the other two books in the trilogy. Why do all households in Panem get the Bravo network? Should \xe2\x80\x9c1984\xe2\x80\x9d be a Little Golden Book? And why does Lisa know which district of Panem is in charge of making lumber? This episode has the odds ever in its favor. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell   with Lisa Schmeiser and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, Take off all your clothes and set the lock code on your mobile phone! It\xe2\x80\x99s time for us to discuss the second season of the BBC\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSherlock,\xe2\x80\x9d starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman. We walk through all three movie-length episodes, starting with the exemplary \xe2\x80\x9cScandal in Belgravia,\xe2\x80\x9d moving on to the not-so-exemplary \xe2\x80\x9cHounds of Baskerville,\xe2\x80\x9d and concluding with the mind-blowing \xe2\x80\x9cReichenbach Fall.\xe2\x80\x9d &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Moren, Greg Knauss and John Siracusa.&lt;/p&gt;, We wrap up our six-part series on the classic \xe2\x80\x9cStar Wars\xe2\x80\x9d movies with the climactic final half of \xe2\x80\x9cReturn of the Jedi.\xe2\x80\x9d We discuss how the Empire is ahead of the rebels every step of the way, question Luke\xe2\x80\x99s choice of forest camouflage, and explain why Ewoks are better unsubtitled. Also, how is Luke\xe2\x80\x99s journey to being a Jedi not like what you see in most action movies? Who is more heroic in the end, Luke or Vader? Why does the Emperor wait so long to show us his lightning fingers? Why are rebel ships equipped with fireworks? And is Endor the name of the moon, or the name of the planet the moon is orbiting, or both? &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Moren, John Siracusa and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, We tackle the last of the classic \xe2\x80\x9cStar Wars\xe2\x80\x9d trilogy, \xe2\x80\x9cReturn of the Jedi.\xe2\x80\x9d Why does Jabba the Hutt enjoy avant-garde wall hangings and \xe2\x80\x9980s dance moves? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it sad how Boba Fett goes out with a whimper? Are the alien languages in \xe2\x80\x9cStar Wars\xe2\x80\x9d too fake-sounding? And what\xe2\x80\x99s up with Leia\xe2\x80\x99s metal bikini? (Part 1 of 2.) &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Moren, John Siracusa and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, Here be dragons! Special guest hosts Glenn Fleishman and Lisa Schmeiser discuss books featuring winged and scaly creatures, from Anne McCaffrey to George R.R. Martin. Glenn and Lisa are joined by special guest stars Dori Smith and Sarah Barbour, who are also knowledgeable in the ways of the dragon. &lt;p&gt;Host Glenn Fleishman   with Lisa Schmeiser and Sarah Barbour.&lt;/p&gt;, Get out your magic wands, prepare your incantations, and prepare for a battle of wills involving ancient powers and callow youths. We discuss two recent novels with magic at the fore: Lev Grossman\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe Magicians\xe2\x80\x9d and Erin Morgenstern\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe Night Circus.\xe2\x80\x9d One of them we liked a lot\xe2\x80\xa6 the other, not so much! Prepare yourself for a magical podcast. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman, Scott McNulty and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, It\xe2\x80\x99s the Incomparable Game Show! In a clash of young(ish) versus old(ish), two teams vie for the honor of being the team who wins. Sci-fi questions, confused androids, and a visit from a parallel-universe version of The Incomparable are all part of the story. You\xe2\x80\x99ll laugh, you\xe2\x80\x99ll cry, and you won\xe2\x80\x99t learn a darned thing. Join us, won\xe2\x80\x99t you? &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell        with Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman, Greg Knauss, John Siracusa, Scott McNulty, Steve Lutz and Tony Sindelar.&lt;/p&gt;, Please join us for Jason and John\xe2\x80\x99s survey of the films of director Hayao Miyazaki. Even if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have kids, like animation, or care about Japan, we think these are some of the greatest films ever made. From \xe2\x80\x9cMy Neighbor Totoro\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cKiki\xe2\x80\x99s Delivery Service\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cSpirited Away\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cNausicaa,\xe2\x80\x9d we cover the highlights (and oddities) of his filmmaking career. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell  with John Siracusa.&lt;/p&gt;, Who Watches the Watchmen? We discuss Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons\xe2\x80\x99s classic comic \xe2\x80\x9cWatchmen.\xe2\x80\x9d What made it remarkable and influential? Is it too stuck in an \xe2\x80\x9980s sensibility? Did the movie ruin everything? And will the recently-announced prequels stink? &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Lisa Schmeiser, Ben Boychuk, Steve Lutz and Tony Sindelar.&lt;/p&gt;, It\xe2\x80\x99s the end of the world! And since our eyeglasses are intact, we have time enough at last, to read. We discuss Maureen McHugh\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cAfter the Apocalypse\xe2\x80\x9d short-story collection, Cormac McCarthy\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe Road,\xe2\x80\x9d and other apocalypse tales we have known. Do zombies have their own David Attenborough, leading expeditions into Cleveland? Why should you be afraid if heavy snowfall combines with the appearance of strange invisible magic ghost sex-dragon monsters? And why does John Siracusa plan to ride out the apocalypse in style? We ask several of these questions, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to listen to see if we ever answer any of them. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with John Siracusa, Lisa Schmeiser and Scott McNulty.&lt;/p&gt;, We close the books on the first Incomparable Film Festival with this special follow-up episode. We provide the show times for each day of the festival, share your feedback, and reveal the results of your vote for the best slate of films. We also check in with two panelists who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make the original draft, one of whom has a bone to pick with John Siracusa. The other one instead tells a heartwarming tale of projectile vomiting. (Part 3 of 2.) &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell       with Dan Moren, Greg Knauss, Lex Friedman, Scott McNulty, Serenity Caldwell and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;, Continuing our assembly of the Incomparable Film Festival! We fill out our list of 35 classic films for imaginary display to imaginary crowds. Find out our final 21 (or is it 22?) choices! Then vote for your favorites. (Part 2 of 2.) &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell       with Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman, John Siracusa, Scott McNulty, Serenity Caldwell and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;, We\xe2\x80\x99re creating the Incomparable Film Festival! Each day for a week, one of us will introduce five films (to be screened at an imaginary location not to be determined). To prevent duplication of selections, our seven participants will choose favorite films in a draft format. When all is said and done, 35 classic movies will be chosen by our panel of geeks. (Part 1 of 2.) &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell       with Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman, John Siracusa, Scott McNulty, Serenity Caldwell and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;, Our Comic Book Club gets in a romantic mood with a discussion of comic-book romances\xe2\x80\x94the (very) few that have stood the test of time and the (very) many that have been thwarted by clones, telepaths, cloned telepaths, and\xe2\x80\x94worst of all\xe2\x80\x94Satan\xe2\x80\x99s Annulment. Also, what are we reading? &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell  with Lisa Schmeiser.&lt;/p&gt;, Step through your time portal, buy some cheap 1950s hamburger, and prepare for our discussion of Stephen King\xe2\x80\x99s new novel 11/22/63. How does a 21st century man react to the racism and sexism of the south in the mid-20th century? Would the world have been a better place if Kennedy hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been assassinated? Is Canada really eyeing the state of Maine anxiously? Like the book, we have some\xe2\x80\x94but not all\xe2\x80\x94of the answers. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Dan Moren, John Siracusa, Lisa Schmeiser and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, Live from the Macworld |iWorld Live Stage, it\xe2\x80\x99s a discussion of our favorite (and least favorite) uses of technology in movies, TV shows, books, and more. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, Go north, get lamp, and check your inventory, as guest host Greg Knauss takes you on a journey into the world of interactive fiction, also known as \xe2\x80\x9ctext adventures.\xe2\x80\x9d Did families in the \xe2\x80\x9980s really sit around the Apple II playing \xe2\x80\x9cMystery House?\xe2\x80\x9d Will saving a game really erase your floppy disc? Listen if you dare, but watch out for grues! &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Greg Knauss, Monty Ashley and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;, It\xe2\x80\x99s fun for the whole family, as we discuss some of our favorite movies for kids (and their parents). Did we really recommend an animated movie from Dreamworks? And a movie with Melanie Griffith? And a German fantasy film? Well, yes, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to listen to find out which ones. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell   with John Siracusa and Lex Friedman.&lt;/p&gt;, We bid farewell to 2011 by listing the favorite things we inhaled into our brains during the past year. We also recall our favorite podcast moments, read a whole bunch of listener comments, and more. (Although this is a clip show, two-thirds of the running time is actually original material!) &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Dan Moren, Scott McNulty, Serenity Caldwell and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;, All hail the power of motherhood! We discuss this year\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cDoctor Who\xe2\x80\x9d Christmas special, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Doctor, the Widow, and the Wardrobe.\xe2\x80\x9d Plus, why Christmas episodes make us feel warm inside, and the amazing scanner-blocking powers of wool! &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman, Scott McNulty and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, Grab some eggnog and hitch up your reindeer! It\xe2\x80\x99s time to put six holiday films in the Incomparable Film Vault! We discuss some beloved classics and offer a few surprise choices that redefine what \xe2\x80\x9choliday\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cfilm\xe2\x80\x9d actually mean. What is a realistic depiction of Santa? Is Bill Murray\xe2\x80\x99s best Scrooge not actually in \xe2\x80\x9cScrooged\xe2\x80\x9d? Has Clarence the angel left a trail of dead bodies behind him? Is Kris Kringle the original Apple Genius? Happy holidays, everyone! &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with Andy Ihnatko, Dan Frakes, Glenn Fleishman, Serenity Caldwell and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;, It turns out we all like They Might Be Giants! So we did an entire episode about geeky music. We pick favorite TMBG songs, and then bring up some other geeky tracks we love by Fountains of Wayne, Moxy Fr\xc3\x83\xc2\xbcvous, and \xe2\x80\x9cWeird Al\xe2\x80\x9d Yankovic. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Glenn Fleishman, Lex Friedman and Scott McNulty.&lt;/p&gt;, Break out your gaming laptop and pass the ammunition: It\xe2\x80\x99s time to discuss Neal Stephenson\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cREAMDE.\xe2\x80\x9d Why does the book\xe2\x80\x99s plot take a hard left turn halfway through? Why does Stephenson struggle to write endings\xe2\x80\x94and does he succeed this time? Is this book about family, the victory of the outsider, or blowing things up? (Can\xe2\x80\x99t it be all three?) &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman, Scott McNulty and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, Gather some bounty hunters and warm up the carbon freezer! It\xe2\x80\x99s time for the conclusion of our epic discussion of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Empire Strikes Back.\xe2\x80\x9d We dissect the evolution of the Han-Leia relationship, the truly playful nature of Yoda and the importance of Dagobah, Vader\xe2\x80\x99s agenda and his crunchy gloves, and Luke\xe2\x80\x99s continuing adventures with garbage. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Moren, John Siracusa and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, Launch your probe droids and cut open your tauntaun! It\xe2\x80\x99s time for part one of our two-part discussion of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Empire Strikes Back.\xe2\x80\x9d Does Han Solo just want to be loved? Is Chewie sabotaging the Falcon on purpose? Why is snowy Hoth the setting? Why is Ben Kenobi a man of few words? Who\xe2\x80\x99s scruffy-lookin\xe2\x80\x99? And what is the purpose for Darth Vader\xe2\x80\x99s clamshell office, anyway? &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Moren, John Siracusa and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, Ernest Cline\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cReady Player One\xe2\x80\x9d is a sci-fi novel that\xe2\x80\x99s chock full of references to 1980s culture. But is it a good book, or are the references all that it\xe2\x80\x99s got going for it? What will John Hughes movies be like in the future? And what do Cline, P.G. Wodehouse, and Umberto Eco have in common? &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with Dan Moren, John Siracusa, Scott McNulty, Serenity Caldwell and Monty Ashley.&lt;/p&gt;, A new TV season is here! We analyze the new shows, plus some returning favorites. Among our targets: Revenge, Homeland, Terra Nova, Once Upon a Time, Grimm, Person of Interest, American Horror Story, Ringer, A Gifted Man, Boss, and returning shows The Walking Dead, Fringe, Community, Supernatural, Haven, and Dexter. Also: Why does Scott McNulty think every show is Prime Suspect? &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with Dan Moren, Lisa Schmeiser, Scott McNulty, John Siracusa and Ben Boychuk.&lt;/p&gt;, When you want to get in the Halloween spirit, who you gonna call? Join us in celebrating 1984\xe2\x80\x99s supernatural comedy classic, \xe2\x80\x9cGhostbusters.\xe2\x80\x9d Are ghosts a serious environmental hazard requiring the intervention of the EPA? Why do the Ghostbusters transform from college professors into blue-collar plumbers when they put on their jump suits? Is Roasted Terror Dog with Human Nougat the worst candy ever devised? And which one of our panelists attended a cat-themed bat mitzvah in the same ballroom destroyed by the Ghostbusters? &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Moren, Serenity Caldwell and Ben Boychuk.&lt;/p&gt;, Is \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wise Man\xe2\x80\x99s Fear\xe2\x80\x9d a rich fantasy novel about storytelling and myth-making, or is it a collection of good story elements scattered across an overlong plot? Could it be both? Ninjas! Off-camera shipwrecks! Board games! Sexism! Off-camera courtroom drama! Discursions within digressions within framing sequences! Join us as we discuss yet another 1000-page fantasy novel, the sequel to \xe2\x80\x9cThe Name of the Wind.\xe2\x80\x9d &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Dan Moren, John Siracusa, Scott McNulty and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, We discuss \xe2\x80\x9cA Dance With Dragons,\xe2\x80\x9d the latest 1000-page installment in George R.R. Martin\xe2\x80\x99s bestselling \xe2\x80\x9cSong of Ice and Fire\xe2\x80\x9d fantasy series. Is this series going to end well? Which parts of this book were good, and which just treaded water? Would adding Klingons have helped? Why are trees the Westeros equivalent of security cameras? These are the sorts of questions you ask deep in the middle of a long fantasy series. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Moren, Scott McNulty and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, Our Comic Book Club tackles the topic of #1 issues, especially those in DC\xe2\x80\x99s recent relaunch. We recommend some books and talk about some of our favorite Number Ones. Also we touch on a few of the controversial #1 DC issues and question whether DC is really trying to reach a new audience or just pander to the old one. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Benjamin, Faith Korpi and Lisa Schmeiser.&lt;/p&gt;, Why do secret agents wear make-up under their eyepatches? When do text messages not properly convey thanks for saving the universe? Are the Cybermen the worst villians ever? We wrap up the sixth season of \xe2\x80\x9cDoctor Who\xe2\x80\x9d with discussion of the last three episodes as well as the season as a whole. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman, John Siracusa, Scott McNulty and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, We conclude our TV Fantasy Draft with the unveiling of our series pitches. Vampire and ghost detectives! Star Trek meets the West Wing! A sitcom starring a robot and an omnipotent being! A gritty techno-drama. A psychedelic drama set on a Zeppelin! And John Siracusa\xe2\x80\x99s pitch seems awfully familiar somehow. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell       with Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman, John Siracusa, Scott McNulty, Serenity Caldwell and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;, Who are the best TV characters of all time? Six people set out to draft teams of 10 characters each, from which they would form some of the strangest TV ensembles ever seen. Will Captain Kirk, Columbo, and The Fonz end up on the same show? Perhaps the craziest episode we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever done highlights dozens of our favorite characters from TV history. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with Dan Moren, John Siracusa, Scott McNulty, Serenity Caldwell and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;, This past summer\xe2\x80\x99s superhero movies are in the spotlight! Are the gods just aliens? When are mutant strippers unrealistic? Why would you beat up people after costing them their jobs? And why do the Stark boys enjoy themselves\xe2\x80\x94and cheesy foodstuffs\xe2\x80\x94so much? Our esteemed panel breaks down how \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain America,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThor,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cX-Men: First Class,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cGreen Lantern\xe2\x80\x9d fared. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Moren, Monty Ashley and Tony Sindelar.&lt;/p&gt;, Press the Green Anchor and jump into a parallel timestream: it\xe2\x80\x99s time to talk \xe2\x80\x9cDoctor Who.\xe2\x80\x9d In this flash episode we deconstruct the two most recent episodes, \xe2\x80\x9cNight Terrors\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Girl Who Waited.\xe2\x80\x9d And here\xe2\x80\x99s a hint: we liked one of them way more than the other. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with Dan Moren, John Siracusa, Glenn Fleishman, Scott McNulty and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, This podcast is cancelled! We discuss TV shows that failed to reach their proper natural lifespan. When all is said and done, you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear recommendations for 25 excellent series that burned bright and weren\xe2\x80\x99t allowed to fade away. Fantasy football drafts were never this good. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman, Scott McNulty and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, Strap on your jet pack and locate your pet monkey! Our Comic Book Club reconvenes to discuss works by writer Brian K. Vaughan, who excels at the high-concept premise. In the spotlight: \xe2\x80\x9cRunaways,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cY: The Last Man,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cEx Machina.\xe2\x80\x9d With plenty of digressions along the way, about feminism, parenting, sexism, and (once again) how hard it is to write an ending. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell  with Lisa Schmeiser.&lt;/p&gt;, Flash podcast! A largely unedited Skype conversation after this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cDoctor Who\xe2\x80\x9d midseason premiere, \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s Kill Hitler.\xe2\x80\x9d &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman, Scott McNulty and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, Rip off your hearing limbs and join us for the first anniversary edition of The Incomparable. As with the first podcast, the Book Club discusses a China Mi\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9ville novel: in this case, \xe2\x80\x9cEmbassytown.\xe2\x80\x9d Also: What are we reading? Glenn is reading a comic book. We are disappointed. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman and Scott McNulty.&lt;/p&gt;, We read the 2011 Hugo nominees for Best Novel. Sit back and enjoy our reviews of \xe2\x80\x9cBlackout/All Clear,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cCryoburn,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Dervish House,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cFeed,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Hundred Thousand Kingdoms.\xe2\x80\x9d Plus, we recommend a few of the nominated short stories. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman and Scott McNulty.&lt;/p&gt;, Talking \xe2\x80\x9cFinding Nemo,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cToy Story 2,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cWall-E.\xe2\x80\x9d Plus, we discuss what Pixar should do next to challenge itself, try to understand why \xe2\x80\x9cCars 2\xe2\x80\x9d was made, and pick out our least favorite thing Pixar has ever done. Hint: Jason has a problem with rats. (Part 2 of 2.) &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell   with John Siracusa and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;, Old men with balloons! Wisecracking monsters! Superheroes with mid-life crises! The films of Pixar are in our sights this week. Join us as we pick our favorite films and explore why Pixar\xe2\x80\x99s movies are better than those from other animation studios. (Part 1 of 2.) &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell   with John Siracusa and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;, From the Wall in the north (behind which lurk the fearsome White Walkers) to across the Narrow Sea (which is sort of dull), the first season of HBO\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cGame of Thrones\xe2\x80\x9d has everything the George R. R. Martin book has, with perhaps more attractive naked people having sex in front of you.  Also: Uncomfortable chairs. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with Dan Moren, John Siracusa, Scott McNulty, Serenity Caldwell and Monty Ashley.&lt;/p&gt;, Continuing our discussion of \xe2\x80\x9cStar Wars,\xe2\x80\x9d the original film. We praise the jump to hyperspace, explain why TIE fighter pilots wear black, ponder how Han and Leia somehow turn up in an Aaron Sorkin scene, reveal why there is no Space OSHA, comment on Ben Kenobi\xe2\x80\x99s old man slippers and incomparable pseudonym, and expose the rebellion so rich it can have its own university and mint its own medals. (Part 2 of 2.) &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Dan Moren, John Siracusa, Scott McNulty and Greg Knauss.&lt;/p&gt;, \xe2\x80\x9cStar Wars,\xe2\x80\x9d the original film, is finally in our crosshairs, and if we can bulls-eye a Womp Rat we can take on this classic sci-fi film. We talk about our first memories of Star Wars, pretend the prequels didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, give Cantina drink-ordering tips, and marvel at Darth Vader\xe2\x80\x99s coffee-drinking habits. (Part 1 of 2.) &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Dan Moren, John Siracusa, Scott McNulty and Greg Knauss.&lt;/p&gt;, Pour yourself a White Mickey and listen to our discussion of the first half of \xe2\x80\x9cDoctor Who\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d split season. We discuss \xe2\x80\x9cThe Rebel Flesh,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cA Good Man Goes to War,\xe2\x80\x9d and the season as a whole. Or half? We also debate the merits of Lesbian Victorian Silurians and Auton Roman Centurions. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman, John Siracusa, Scott McNulty and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, DC decides to stick a fork in continuity and reboot its universe. Publicity stunt, bold creative move, or both? Andy Ihnatko joins Lisa, Jason, and the good Jason to discuss this latest attempt to save the comics industry. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell  with Andy Ihnatko.&lt;/p&gt;, Everybody\xe2\x80\x99s got an adorable parallel-universe nickname \xe2\x80\x94 The Walternate! Flauxlivia! Pacey! \xe2\x80\x94 on the always unpredictable Fox sci-fi show Fringe.  Sure, it\xe2\x80\x99s no Lost (nor X-Files, nor \xe2\x80\x9cEnemy Within\xe2\x80\x9d) but it\xe2\x80\x99s got its charms, including high-speed pregnancy, Leonard Nimoy impressions and cast members from \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wire\xe2\x80\x9d not being given enough interesting things to do. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell   with Dan Moren and John Siracusa.&lt;/p&gt;, Do you know where your towel is? Are you a hoopy frood? Have you just consumed your fifth Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster? We have. And you\xe2\x80\x99d better catch up. In honor of our 42nd podcast and the recent Towel Day, The Incomparable celebrates the life and work of Douglas Adams. We feature our special guest, Yoz Grahame, who worked for Adams\xe2\x80\x99 The Digital Village, the producers of Web sites such as h2g2.com (a precursor to Wikipedia of sorts). &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Glenn Fleishman, Greg Knauss and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;, Turn on your flux capacitors, calculate how many \xe2\x80\x9cjigabytes\xe2\x80\x9d your hard drive contrains, and prepare for our deconstruction of the \xe2\x80\x9cBack to the Future\xe2\x80\x9d movie series. Which film reigns supreme? Plus, we talk about other time-travel movies we love. This episode recorded entirely live in a tiny, enclosed space. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Dan Moren, Serenity Caldwell, Lex Friedman and Dan Frakes.&lt;/p&gt;, After long delays, our Comic Book Club discusses Warren Ellis and John Cassaday\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cPlanetary,\xe2\x80\x9d which is only fitting given that the 27-issue series took 10 years to be released. We also talk about how hard it is to write a satisfying ending to any fictional work. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell  with Lisa Schmeiser.&lt;/p&gt;, Neil Gaiman breathes life into the TARDIS in this week\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cDoctor Who\xe2\x80\x9d episode, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s Wife.\xe2\x80\x9d We discuss what we liked about this much-hyped episode, as well as detailing how Rory dies this week. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman and Scott McNulty.&lt;/p&gt;, Our Book Club discusses the works of sci-fi writer John Scalzi, including \xe2\x80\x9cOld Man\xe2\x80\x99s War.\xe2\x80\x9d We also talk about \xe2\x80\x9cThe Forever War\xe2\x80\x9d and many other books. We play the \xe2\x80\x9cnew author remakes classic novel\xe2\x80\x9d game we just invented. Find out why Dan says \xe2\x80\x9cCe Podcast est Fini!\xe2\x80\x9d And stay after the end to learn Jason\xe2\x80\x99s secret plan to create a terrible sci-fi trilogy. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell   with Dan Moren and Scott McNulty.&lt;/p&gt;, Flash discussion of Doctor Who\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cCurse of the Black Spot.\xe2\x80\x9d We try to give it CPR, but we do it wrong and the patient dies. Or, no, wait! It came back to life! Hooray! Unrelated: why Rory is like Kenny from \xe2\x80\x9cSouth Park.\xe2\x80\x9d &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell   with Dan Moren and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, Flash! A discussion about the first two episodes of this season of \xe2\x80\x9cDoctor Who,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Impossible Astronaut\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cDay of the Moon.\xe2\x80\x9d Who is in that spacesuit? Who is the little girl? Are the Silence just lazy? We speculate wildly. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman, John Siracusa and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, Everybody wants to rule the world, er, kingdom of Westeros. As the \xe2\x80\x9cGame of Thrones\xe2\x80\x9d series continues on HBO, we discuss the source material: George R.R. Martin\xe2\x80\x99s bestselling \xe2\x80\x9cSong of Ice and Fire\xe2\x80\x9d books. If you haven\xe2\x80\x99t read the books, you will be spoiled! We\xe2\x80\x99ll post the climactic resolution of this podcast in about five years, so invest your time wisely. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Moren, Scott McNulty and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, Based on the best-selling novel! Inspired by HBO\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cGame of Thrones,\xe2\x80\x9d in this episode we discuss the translation of books to the screen. Should movies be faithful to the book? Is it better if filmmmakers take liberties? And what books do we wish would be made into movies? If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to listen to this episode, just buy the novelization. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Moren, John Siracusa and Scott McNulty.&lt;/p&gt;, The lesson learned? Never share anything you love with John Siracusa. Like, for example, \xe2\x80\x9cReal Genius.\xe2\x80\x9d Or any \xe2\x80\x9980s movie. Or any \xe2\x80\x9980s anything. Or from-any-other-time anything. Fear John Siracusa, for he is the destroyer of dreams. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Dan Moren, John Siracusa, Glenn Fleishman and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, This time, on the Incomparable: Ted Chiang short stories, including the anthology \xe2\x80\x9cThe Story of Your Life and Others.\xe2\x80\x9d Plus, enough recommendations to get you through every bathroom break and bus ride for the next three years. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Glenn Fleishman, Lisa Schmeiser and Scott McNulty.&lt;/p&gt;, An entire hour devoted to The CW\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSupernatural.\xe2\x80\x9d Can you imagine it? Brr. Fortunately, that\xe2\x80\x99s not what this podcast is about. It\xe2\x80\x99s about stuff we think is funny. Only one of likes \xe2\x80\x9cSupernatural.\xe2\x80\x9d To find out who, you will need to listen. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman, Scott McNulty, Serenity Caldwell and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;, Make it so, Number One! Star Trek: The Next Generation is on our agenda. We talk favorite episodes, least-favorite episodes, killer snowflakes, why Jean-Luc Picard is catnip to the ladies, why everyone loves Geordi, and why in the future no one needs Wet Wipes. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman, Lisa Schmeiser and Scott McNulty.&lt;/p&gt;, A hero with an unpronounceable name, magic that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually do much, cardboard female characters, a story where nothing really happens, and the first and inconclusive part of a longer series?  Sounds like an acclaimed fantasy novel to us!  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Name of the Wind\xe2\x80\x9d on this week\xe2\x80\x99s Incomparable Podcast. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with John Siracusa, Dan Moren and Scott McNulty.&lt;/p&gt;, Zombie, Spaceship, or Wasteland? We explore the reasons Geek Culture exists, what it means, and if it really exists. Also: are nerds just as awful and exclusionary as jocks? Why will Oprah sit astride the apocalypse? Find out what happened when Scott McNulty met Kitty Pryde. And most importantly, learn the deadly secret about how Dungeons and Dragons relates to nuclear submarines. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with John Siracusa, Lisa Schmeiser and Scott McNulty.&lt;/p&gt;, Turn on your perpetual-motion machine, man your Zeppelin, and fly away for our next edition of the Incomparable Book Club. We discuss \xe2\x80\x9cThe Dream of Perpetual Motion\xe2\x80\x9d by Dexter Palmer, as well as answer the question, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you reading?\xe2\x80\x9d &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell   with Glenn Fleishman and Scott McNulty.&lt;/p&gt;, Grab your pound of dice, a bag of Cheetos and your +1 wit, to join the Incomparable Podcast as we venture forth into the world of \xe2\x80\x9cDungeons and Dragons\xe2\x80\x9d and other role-playing games.  Hey, at least we don\xe2\x80\x99t LARP. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Dan Moren, Scott McNulty, Jason Tocci and Tony Sindelar.&lt;/p&gt;, Hello. Our name is The Incomparable. You killed our father. Prepare to listen to a spoiler-filled podcast about the most quotable movie in the universe, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Princess Bride.\xe2\x80\x9d &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman, Greg Knauss and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, Dive through a wormhole to defend the honor of the Imperium! We discuss Lois McMaster Bujold\xe2\x80\x99s Vorkosigan series of novels, which we really can\xe2\x80\x99t recommend highly enough. It\xe2\x80\x99s swashbuckling Sci-Fi adventure with some great characters and a big canvas. And you can read most of them for free! &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Moren, Scott McNulty and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, Don your mask and cape and join us for a discussion of the good, the underrated, and the overrated in the realm of superhero movies. And you think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to praise \xe2\x80\x9cThe Dark Knight\xe2\x80\x9d you might be in for quite a shock\xe2\x80\xa6 No, seriously, we rip it apart. We also discuss \xe2\x80\x9cSuperman 2,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDarkman,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIron Man,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMegamind,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Incredibles,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cUnbreakable,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Rocketeer,\xe2\x80\x9d and many others. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with John Siracusa, Serenity Caldwell and Ben Boychuk.&lt;/p&gt;, Recorded live and in person before a studio audience (of one)!

Also: the debut of the Spoiler Quack. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, Comic Book Club returns with a discussion of comic-book \xe2\x80\x9cspecial events,\xe2\x80\x9d and why they are (in most cases) amazingly disappointing. We discuss our favorite and least-favorite events, from Crisis on Infinite Earths to Civil War to that time that Superman fought Spider-Man. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell   with Lisa Schmeiser and Jason Brightman.&lt;/p&gt;, Get your hat and your shotgun and prepare for the Zombie Apocalypse! We discuss AMC\xe2\x80\x99s TV series \xe2\x80\x9cThe Walking Dead,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as touch on some zombie movies including \xe2\x80\x9cZombieland\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cDawn of the Dead.\xe2\x80\x9d &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell   with John Siracusa and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;, Hop in your time machine and listen to our latest Book Club installment\xe2\x80\x94and then be sure to travel back and prevent the podcast from having ever been recorded, because time travel is tricky like that. We discuss \xe2\x80\x9cHow to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe\xe2\x80\x9d and other time travel books we have liked. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell   with Glenn Fleishman and Scott McNulty.&lt;/p&gt;, If you do something every Christmas for six years, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to call it a tradition. And so we have to add the \xe2\x80\x9cDoctor Who\xe2\x80\x9d Christmas special to our lists. We enjoyed this year\xe2\x80\x99s episode, \xe2\x80\x9cA Christmas Carol,\xe2\x80\x9d so much, we recorded this flash podcast to talk about it. Happy holidays, everyone. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman, Scott McNulty and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, Is \xe2\x80\x9cDie Hard\xe2\x80\x9d the greatest Christmas movie ever made? Dan Moren thinks so. Others are less sure, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying how great this seminal \xe2\x80\x9980s action flick is. We discuss John McClane\xe2\x80\x99s adventure at Nakatomi Plaza, as well as other Christmas movies and TV shows we have loved. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Moren, Greg Knauss and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;, Happy holidays from everyone at The Incomparable.

When should creators go back and use computers to \xe2\x80\x9cimprove\xe2\x80\x9d their work? And does Jeff Bridges\xe2\x80\x99 CGI doppelganger fall right into the middle of the Uncanny Valley? &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Moren, John Siracusa and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, A new topic on the podast: video games!

From Pong to the Kinect, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got it covered\xe2\x80\x94plus why the human race is doomed if someone invents a holodeck. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with Dan Moren, John Siracusa, Greg Knauss, Steve Lutz and Tony Sindelar.&lt;/p&gt;, In honor of the release of the seventh Harry Potter film, we convene a collection of panelists to discuss the books, the movies, the phenomenon that is J.K. Rowling\xe2\x80\x99s young-wizard saga. (If you haven\xe2\x80\x99t read the series, there are spoilers and also the entire podcast will make no sense. Except for the part about \xe2\x80\x9cMagnum P.I.\xe2\x80\x9d and Pablo Picasso. This episode sponsored by the word \xe2\x80\x9cexegesis\xe2\x80\x9d and the musical stylings of Tom Bombadil.) &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Moren, Glenn Fleishman and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;, Discussing Joss Whedon, from Buffy to Firefly (to the Avengers?) and everything in between.

aS'The New Disruptors tells stories that provide practical inspiration about the way that creative people and producers connect with audiences to perform, cajole, convince, sell, and interact using new methods. Hosted by Glenn Fleishman, a regular contributor to The Economist and the editor and publisher of The Magazine. Produced by Aperiodical LLC., Jen Bekman, Zo\xc3\xab Salditch, and Mike Merrill were our guests live on stage at the XOXO 2014 festival in Portland, Oregon, as part of the Story evening that also featured Hrishikesh Hirway\'s Song Exploder, featuring a song by The Thermals; John Roderick (The Long Winters) interviewing Chelsea Cain; and Harmontown with Dino Stamatopoulos.Jen Bekman founded 20x200 in 2007 to provide art at accessible prices. She spoke about her in work in 2012 at XOXO. Then she had a terrible, no good, very bad year. For a lot of reasons, she can\'t discuss the particulars of what happened, but she had to reboot 20x200: its site, its technology, its art, and its trust with existing customers.If you have beautiful digital art, you need a place to display it. That\'s the idea behind Electronic Objects, a massively funded Kickstarter project from a month ago. But Zo\xc3\xab Salditch\'s interest is less in the technology than the uses to which people will put it. In the midst of producing their EO1 model, they have artists in residence working on concpetual ideas and are considering one future for their hardware as a platform for art \xe2\x80\x94 maybe 20x200 and EO have a lot in common?With most people, saying "I can buy and sell you" is a boast about one\'s own ostensible net worth. With Mike Merrill, it\'s the literal truth. Mike is a publicly traded company, and shareholders can vote on the course his life takes, including how he pursues romantic interests. Shares in KMIKEYM have traded as high as $25 and typically change hands in a band of $5 to $10. Volume is low.This is our last regularly scheduled episode as we go on hiatus and consider a path forward.

You may know him from the early 2000s: from Suck.com and Metababy and Rainy Day Fun and Games for Toddler and Total Bastard, a collection of stories he promoted on what was arguably the first digital book tour. Then for a decade he toiled behind the scenes until he went out on his own. We\'ll talk today about his expectations, the reality, and fear of failing--and of succeeding!Sponsored by:This episode is sponsored by:lynda.com: Over 2,000 high-quality and engaging video courses taught by industry experts \xe2\x80\x94 with new courses added daily.

He\'s been on the Internet for as long as there\'s been an Internet for all us to get on. He was part of the founding team of Wired magazine, and the author of many inspiring books and essays about technological change and self-empowerment, including "1,000 True Fans."

The GaymerX event is meant to be inclusive of all people, but especially those harassed, marginalized, or ridiculed in mainstream gaming.

For the day after Christmas, it seems appropriate to celebrate generosity and gift culture with Mark Frauenfelder, David Pescovitz, Cory Doctorow, and Xeni Jardin.As with all the sessions at XOXO, the presentation is Creative Commons licensed, and I separately obtained permission from Andy Baio and Andy McMillan. Thanks, too, to Mike Gebhardt and Betty Farrier of brytCAST.com, the folks who videotaped throughout XOXO 2012 and 2013, for providing the high-quality audio file., Jay Fanelli and Nathan Peretic know how to go it on their own. They\'ve done it not just once, not just twice, but now three times. They formed the interactive-services company Full Stop Interactive, out of which United Pixelworkers was formed, a company that produces fine wearable merchandise. And United Pixelworkers gave birth to Cotton Bureau, a site that uses crowdfunding to pick which shirts should get printed. Now they\'re doubling down and focusing entirely on the T-shirt and merchandise businesses. (Support The New Disruptors at http://www.patreon.com/glennf directly as a patron.), The New Disruptors launched on December 5, 2012. I wanted to talk to people making stuff, creating art, or helping others get their work out there. The show is now at episode 53, and it\'s been a delightful year. I wanted to look back at early guests, and was able to get the folks who appeared on the first four episodes to chat briefly about what happened next. I talk in this show with Lisanne Pajot and James Swirksy, Indie Game: The Movie; Chris Anderson, then Wired and now 3DRobotics; Tony Konecny, Tonx (coffee); and Evan Ratliff, of The Atavist and Creativist. This episode is sponsored by TextExpander from Smile Software. http://smilesoftware.com/nd, Jean MacDonald was formerly best known for her role as a software marketing and public-relations guru for a major Macintosh software developer, but her work to create App Camp for Girls has eclipsed that. Jean and her colleagues raised over $100,000 on Indiegogo to fund an initial two sessions of a week each in her hometown of Portland, Oregon, and the next step is national. Jean talks about the particular challenges of bootstrapping a non-profit from zero through crowdfunding, and the group\'s efforts in navigating their way to the next steps., Since January 2009, Jonathan Mann has posted a song every day. Not five days a week: seven days a week. There is no rest for the wickedly productive. While he makes his living by writing and performing bespoke songs for organizations, Jonathan never stops creating for himself \xe2\x80\x94 and his fans., This podcast often emphasizes going it alone. But what if you could achieve your own dreams of continuous learning and creative expression while also having full-time jobs and getting that mythical thing, a regular paycheck? I talk with Alli Dryer and Jenni Leder, user interface/user experience (UI/UX) designers, who changed their lives \xe2\x80\x94 and those of their husbands \xe2\x80\x94 to bring their lives closer to what they want within the structure of employment. We talk about that most scary of words to your host, a J-O-B, in this episode. This episode is sponsored by Smile Software\'s TextExpander and Cards Against Humanity., We recorded a special live episode of The New Disruptors in Brooklyn\'s fantastic DUMBO district in the Galapagos Art Space as part of the Nearly Impossible conference in which we talked about the joys, challenges, and surprises in prototyping, funding, producing, and distributing products. On stage, we had Che-Wei Wang and Taylor Levy of CW&amp;T, Tom Gerhardt and Dan Provost of Studio Neat, and Jessica Heltzel of Kern and Burn. Sponsored by Shopify http://shopify.com/nd, Dean Putney has made some of your favorite things on the Internet. He\'s Boing Boing\'s software developer, as well as filling your mind with the best animated GIFs on the Internet. But what he\'s working on at the moment takes us over 100 years into the past: a book of photographs his great-grandfather took before World War I, and in the trenches as a German soldier. He recently funded the book project on Kickstarter, and shares lessons in publishing and crowdfunding. This episode is sponsored by Stack: www.stackmagazines.com (use coupon code DISRUPT13 for a discount)., Marian Call is an Alaskan chanteuse who found an audience after winning a Firefly-related song contest in 2007. She has run her music career as an independent grassroots effort ever since. She connects with her fans constantly and directly, both through social media and crowdfunding, and sleeping on their floors during tours and house concerts. She spends a lot of time on the road, and we talked in person (appropriately enough, in my living room) right after GeekGirlCon 2013 in Seattle in October. She lives on Twitter @mariancall and is currently on tour in Europe., Roman Mars is a public-radio producer. But the definition of what public radio is has become malleable, especially with his show, 99% Invisible, which has enormously more listeners for its podcast version than the broadcast flavor. The show is about design and architecture, and more particularly about the inner workings of things we take for granted. Roman raised a significant sum on Kickstarter in July 2012 \xe2\x80\x94 $170,000 for season 3 of his show. He launched a second Kickstarter for season 4 today (October 22) to expand to weekly episodes and add staff., Jon Mitchell was a mild-mannered reporter at a major metro-webbian publication, Read Write. He left to pursue new ideas about how musicians could find new audiences. He wrote an extraordinary essay about the future of musician-led podcasts recently, and we discuss him, mindfulness, the importance of collaboration, and music. He co-hosts The Portal with fellow musicians and friends Kirk Benttinen and Rebecca Marcyes. This episode is sponsored by Smile Software\'s PDFpen Scan+., Devin Lucas is a writer and director from Southern California, who has made plenty of movies in the past, but nothing quite like the upcoming Under the Smogberry Trees, the true story of Dr Demento and Mr Hansen. He\'s part of Meep Morp Studio with Christine McDonald and Scott McKenzie, which is producing the film., XOXO is a truly remarkable festival and conference that you\'ve heard me talk about quite a lot. I interviewed Andy Baio and Andy McMillan just before they announced the line-up for the 2013 show, which took place in mid-September. At XOXO, I interviewed the folks behind four companies or projects exhibiting there about what they were up to: Brewbot, Draplin Design, Projecteo, and NeoLucida., Yancey Strickler, one of the co-founders of Kickstarter, began his working life in journalism in 2000, and managed to make a living as a freelance writer during one of the most difficult times to ply that trade. A few years later, he joined eMusic, where he rose to editor in chief and started an in-house record label to give bands an easier way to get an album out. He began working on Kickstarter long before its April 2009 debut, and remains as excited about its potential to change artists\' and creators\' lives today as he was before its launch., Sir Mix-A-Lot, a.k.a. Anthony Ray, may have become best known for "Baby Got Back" over 20 years ago, but his career spans nearly 30 years, and he\'s never stopped trying to create a genuine connection with his fans. He\'s a singer, songwriter, producer, actor, technologist, and car aficionado. He runs the independent label Rhyme Cartel. Find him on Twitter @therealmix., James Flynn is a New Zealander who relocated to San Francisco where he runs Extrasensory Devices. He\'s an engineer who started by developing modems, and then released on his own a set of drum-tempo monitors and a light-meter add-on for the iPhone. He\'s launched three Kickstarters, all of which funded, and has plenty more in his pipeline., Jack Conte is a musician and entrepreneur, and one-half of the group Pomplamoose with Nataly Dawn. He and his partner have had millions of people watch their videos on YouTube, and launched a successful career for their stripped-down but layered covers. Jack and Nataly also both have branched into solo work, and Jack recently launched a twist on "conventional" crowdfunding with Patreon, an artist-supporting site., Marisa McClellan puts stuff in jars and it\'s delicious. Her Food in Jars blog on canning and preserving went from a side venture alongside a full-time job to her main hub as a food writer. She writes for Food Network and Table Matters (part of Saveur). She conducts dozens of workshops and demonstrations every year. Her first book is Food in Jars: Preserving in Small Batches Year-Round, and she is in the middle of writing her second book, Preserving by the Pint. You want to pickle something? She\'s your woman., Choire Sicha (pronounced "Corey SEEK-a") is one of the founders of The Awl, a site devoted to new writing and events of the day, with four sister sites under the same umbrella. Choire was an editor at Gawker \xe2\x80\x94 and returned as editor a second time after he first left. He\'s written for or worked at the New York Observer and Radar. Choire just came out with the fictionalized but entirely true novel, Very Recent History: An Entirely Factual Account of a Year (c. AD 2009) in a Large City., David Malki\'s biography would take five minutes to read out. You may know him best as the perpetrator of the cartoon Wondermark, but he\'s also a filmmaker, a movie trailer editor, an author, an entrepreneur, and the Supreme Commander of Publicity &amp; Promotions at TopatoCo, a firm that handles merchandise primarily for webcomics. He\'s available for weddings and bar mitzvahs. We talk about making films, making cartoons, and making books, and having a great time at all of it., Adam Lisagor didn\'t set out to be the face of app advertising, but his acting and directing style mesh perfectly with the zeitgeist. It\'s a bit of irony without the snark. It\'s charming, straightforward, quiet, and informative. You\'ve almost certainly seen his work repeatedly, and once you follow this link to Sandwich Video and watch some of his studio\'s work, you\'ll be able to recognize his work from now on. From his first video to promote an app he was co-developing to the massive amount of work done since, Adam has defined a style that others now aspire to. But this wasn\'t a plan. We\'ll talk about how he got here., Erika Moen has been drawing comics since she was a teenager, and found online success with DAR: A Super Girly Top Secret Comic Diary while working full-time jobs. Fortunately, she was laid off, and moved into new chapters of her life, which included an appearance on the Web reality show Strip Search (from Penny Arcade) and the launch this year of Oh Joy Sex Toy, a regularly appearing comic that reviews and recommends adult paraphernalia. We talk about her career and how the Oh Joy project has consumed all of her time and some of her husband\'s. (This episode contains frank discussions of sex toys and sexuality, a few obscenities, and is marked explicit on iTunes.), Andrew Huang, known as "bunnie" (lowercase) to his friends, first came to the public eye when, while a graduate computer-science student at MIT, he cracked the proprietary wrapper around Microsoft\'s Xbox operating system in 2002, which allowed it then to run any software of his choosing. Microsoft didn\'t like this and MIT told him it wouldn\'t provide any support if a legal defense were needed. Fortunately, Microsoft quickly realized how embarrassing the situation could be, never pursued legal action, and bunnie published a book on the topic. He went on to design the Chumby, a squeezable interactive personal app device, and now works on a variety of projects for the public good, including an open laptop design and an open design for a radiation detector in the wake of the nuclear plant disasters in Japan., People dream of the open road, but do they dream of hitting the highway with thousands of pounds of metal type? Kyle Durrie did, and she\'s spent the last two years crisscrossing America like a Janey Typeseed. She funded her initial excursions almost three years ago through Kickstarter for the Type Truck, a converted packet van from which she teaches about letterpress type and printing. Her Power and Light Press relocated its permanent home last year from Portland to New Mexico, from which state she still takes tours when the roads cooperate.On Twitter: Kyle Durrie, Matthew Amster-Burton is a food writer and host of the podcast Spilled Milk. Matthew has a particular affinity for Japanese food, and that led to a trip to that country he\'d promised to his daughter, Iris, who stars in his book Hungry Monkey. Their trip led to a second visit to Japan with Matthew\'s wife and Iris\'s mom Laurie, and to a second book, Pretty Good Number One, about eating in Tokyo. He talks about the perils of publishing with a large firm and on his own, and how he\'s navigated the maze of electronic book production.Matthew on Twitter: @mamster, Chris Hawker invented the PowerSquid, a multi-pronged power adapter that exploded the notion of the old power strip. It\'s designed for the modern age of power bricks and oversized adapters. With his Trident Design, Chris and his team have created 70 products over 20 years that it licenses to other companies to manufacture. We\'ve talked a lot to first-time industrial designers and producers who\'ve taken advantage of funding and production techniques. Chris offers some insight for the long haul., Matt Bors is an independent political cartoonist. He\'s never had a staff job, and he\'s never drawn a banker holding bags of money where the banker is labeled "BANKER" and the bags of money have giant dollar signs on them. You\'ve certainly seen Matt\'s work before, but you may not have known that he created it. You\'ll recognize his style when you visit his site. Matt joins me from Portland, Oregon, to talk about his whole career, with a special focus on the last year and a half.Find him on Twitter @mattbors., Andy Baio and Andy McMillan simultaneously had the idea for an arts-and-technology conference, and the synchronistic good fortune to wind up in the same city, at the same bar, with the same friend who connected them to talk. The result was XOXO, an event that tore the top of my head right off and led directly to creating this podcast. Hundreds of attendees and tens of thousands of video watchers describe similar enlightenment about what\'s currently possible \xe2\x80\x94 without cynicism, snark, irony, or greed. Andy and Andy talk about the first XOXO in 2012, and preview the second outing, coming in September 2013. (For more, see my photos from 2012 and read an article I wrote for BoingBoing about the event.)Tickets for 2013 will be on sale soon; go to the Web site and sign up for the mailing list to get notified as soon as they are available.On Twitter: Andy Baio, Andy McMillan, and XOXO, as well as the hashtag #xoxofest, still in use., Max Temkin and seven of his friends created the wildly popular and terribly inappropriate party game Cards Against Humanity (CAH), a pastime that Anne Hathaway referred to as "Crimes Against Humanity" at the last Oscars. Before and after the CAH crowdfunding campaign, Max managed four other Kickstarter projects, all successful. We talk about creativity, games, success, and handling boxcars full of printed material in this episode.On Twitter, @MaxTemkin and CAH., Tom Gerhardt and Dan Provost are the two fellows behind Studio Neat, a three-year-old industrial design and software firm that started with an almost accidental bang on Kickstarter. Several projects later, they\'ve shown they\'re no flash in the pan. We talk about crowdfunding, inspiration, and design.On Twitter, Tom, Dan, and Studio Neat., It started as Twitter banter and turned into a blockbuster Kickstarter. The Internet\'s Jonathan Coulton and the comic world\'s Greg Pak have known each other since college. And when Greg put the bug in Jonathan\'s ear about creating a series of comic books based on heros and villains in Jonathan\'s songs, they began a-plotting.A few months later, Code Monkey Saves World launched as a crowdfunding campaign, blew through its goal, and kept stretching and stretching in a way that might strain even Mr. Fantastic or Plasticman \xe2\x80\x94 or even an everyday code monkey. Jonathan and Greg join me to talk about how they planned, executed, and extended their project.On Twitter: Jonathan Coulton, Grek Pak, Code Monkey project, Cory Doctorow (@doctorow) is a essayist, novelist, blogger, and co-editor of BoingBoing, and he is exhausting. The man is a production machine, churning out excellent book after excellent book as if writing were a job instead of something to agonize and procrastinate over. As of this writing, his latest books are Homeland and Pirate Cinema, and, with Charlie Stross, he wrote Rapture of the Nerds. Cory has also long been an advocate for the personal ownership of culture, demanding corporations and governments keep their hands off what we make and their noses out of our individual use and modification of media and hardware. To that end, he has fought endless wars against restrictive legislation., Marco Arment helped bring Tumblr into existence, founded Instapaper and The Magazine, co-hosted the podcast Build &amp; Analyze, and created the podcasts Neutral and Accidental Tech Podcast with Casey Liss and John Siracusa. He has a lot going on, but less than when we recorded this two-part podcast weeks ago. (This is part 2.)I didn\'t know it at the time, but Marco and I spoke as he was finalizing a deal to sell the majority interest in Instapaper. Go back and listen to  Episode #20: So Successful That He Fired Himself (part 1) for how Tumblr and Instapaper grew.In part 2, we talk about Marco\'s podcasts, The Magazine, blogging, advertising, and related topics.On Twitter: Marco Arment, Accidental Tech Podcast, The Magazine., (This is the second half of a conversation with Craig Mod. Part 1 is Episode #17: Everything in Moderation. In it we covered publishing and crowdfunding; in part 2, we talk about how to cope with the multi-platform disruptive future for publications.)Craig Mod writes essays that have the power to change the way you look at everything around you. At regular but somewhat distant intervals, he posts a long bit of writing that retrains your mind to see the world as he does. But he doesn\'t just talk, he creates projects that demonstrate his points as a designer and publisher of print and electronic work.On Twitter, he is @craigmod., Topato Corporation, known as Topatoco for short, has spent nearly a decade fulfilling artists\' dreams. Started by Jeffrey Rowland to ship out merchandise related to his own webcomics, he expanded in 2007 to take on making and delivering books, T-shirts, and related goods for other cartoonists. Our guest, Holly Rowland, has been working with Jeffrey for seven years, and is in charge of a new effort called Make That Thing!, currently in beta testing, to help run crowdfunding projects.On Twitter: Topatoco and Holly Rowland, Marco Arment\'s career has come in two main acts: as the first employee of Tumblr, he helped create a service that changed the fundamental nature of blogging by introducing both ease of creation and social networking. While there, he toyed with a service, to let him read Web pages offline without formatting, that became Instapaper. In late 2010, he left Tumblr to focus on that service full time. Now Marco is a successful podcaster and the editorial director of The Magazine \xe2\x80\x94 the best publication ever created \xe2\x80\x94 at which I\'m the editor and he\'s my boss! (I still have a job after we recorded the podcast.)Our conversation will be aired in two parts, each about an hour long. In this first part, we talk about how as a Tumblr developer Marco found out he didn\'t want to manage people, how Instapaper developed, and issues of managing resources and scaling. In the second, we move further into podcasting, The Magazine, blogging, advertising, and other areas.On Twitter, Marco Arment, Instapaper, and The Magazine., Duncan Davidson and Greg Koenig joined forces a few years back to start Luma Labs, a firm that makes across-the-chest camera straps. The two collaborated first on Luma Loop, a free-sliding camera strap, and then created Cinch, one that holds a camera tighter but still allows for movement. The Loop was kaboshed by a potential patent lawsuit; the second model has been a good seller, but with volume comes decisions about ramping up production. In this episode, we discuss all that, how they developed the original Cinch and Cinch 2 (about to be released), and quite a bit about rapid prototyping.On Twitter, find them at @lumalabs, @duncan, and @gak_pdx (Greg), Aly and Beth Khalifa have decades of experience in product design, both as consultants for clients and in making their own stuff. The Teastick was the first product they made and sold themselves; the Impress coffee filter is the latest. The North Carolina designers are bursting with ideas and work actively to promote collaboration, including in their own shared work space.@GamilDesign on Twitter, Craig Mod writes essays that have the power to change the way you look at everything around you. At regular but somewhat distant intervals, he posts a long bit of writing that retrains your mind to see the world as he does. But he doesn\'t just talk: He creates projects that demonstrate his points as a designer and publisher of print and electronic work.Craig and I had such a great but long conversation that we decided to split it into two parts. This is part 1, about publishing and crowdfunding; part 2, on publishing to different platforms, will air in a few weeks.On Twitter, he is @craigmod., Jonathan Coulton has called into existence a world in which a bearded Brooklyn-residing, Yale-graduated, Whiffenpoof-participating programmer singing songs on nerdy topics he records in a home studio posted to the Internet can quit his job, build an army of fans, give his music partly away, attract 700 people to a themed cruise, become a regular on public radio, and have his work ripped off by a major network television show. We talk about his singing background, how his career began and progressed, and how you bring your fans with you when your style matures., Zach Weinersmith, the artist behind Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal, takes nerdy Web comics to their logical extreme, and has developed a huge following among science geeks. We talk about his career, the popularity of Web comics, and fulfilling big Kickstarter campaigns in this podcast.Find him on Twitter as @zachweiner; his SMBC comics feed is @smbccomics., John Gruber is either the world\'s biggest Apple fanboy or the most nuanced explicator of Cupertino\'s smoke signals, depending on whom you ask and on what day. In a more objective reality, John\'s Daring Fireball is the place you go to if you want to have a bigger-picture understanding of the universe in which Apple is firmly in the center. We talk about how he turned Daring Fireball from a side project into a heavily visited and deeply satisfying outlet for his writing., Dalton Caldwell is the head of App.net (sometimes called ADN for App Dot Net), which some think is a Twitter competitor, but it isn\'t quite. It seems to be a typical venture-backed startup firm, but it is not quite that, either. There\'s a lot more under the surface of App.net, including neutrally hosted services, ecosystems aimed at software developers, and crowdfunding, among other topics, which we talk about in this episode.App.net is offering a limited number of free-tier accounts, introduced last week and explained in the podcast, to listeners of The New Disruptors. Follow this link to sign up. If the link says there are no invitations left, please send me an email (click Contact above) or message us through our Twitter or App.net accounts., Taylor Levy and Che-Wei Wang run CW&amp;T, an art and design studio that produces an array of items ranging from purely commercial to completely aesthetic. The way they string projects along that spectrum offers a lot of insight into how one can fulfill one\'s own artistic vision in a world of commerce. They\'re also the team behind the Pen Type-A, a large and ultimately complicated Kickstarter project that we\'ll get., Lumi makes a fabric-dye that becomes permanent when exposed to bright full-spectrum light, as from the sun. But that\'s not why the founders, Jesse Genet and St\xc3\xa9phan Angoulvant, are on the show. Rather, it\'s the way, starting with an obsession of Jesse\'s when she was 17, that the two bootstrapped a company using collaboration, crowdfunding, and craftiness. , Jason Fried co-founded 37signals, a Web design company that found one of its internal tools for managing projects could be something effectively used by others. Millions of users later, 37signals offers Basecamp (overhauled substantially a year ago), Campfire, and Highrise among other services. The founders not only transformed their business, but routinely help others transform theirs. Fried collaborated on a book called Rework that distills years of what he learned from running a successful company and helping others with theirs.You can look at and sign up for Basecamp as a trial subscription, but this episode isn\'t a product plug; Basecamp fits the disruption mindset. Microsoft Project is perfectly fine software for companies that have employees in one place and need the top-down approach. Software as a service (SaaS) typically involves an application you access via the Web for which data is stored centrally, and updates to the software happen centrally as well. Salesforce, an early SaaS alternative to enterprise-licensed and -managed software, was founded in 1999, and had risen as a force that defined the industry by the time Basecamp came out. Rework may be purchased from Amazon.com and many other fine bookstores.Glenn brought up three concepts relating to 37signals\' work: The Cathedral and the Bazaar, Eric S. Raymond\'s explanation of the difference between software code controlled by a handful of priests and that in the marketplace that\'s open to all; The Cluetrain Manifesto, a provocative set of theses that turned into a revolution and a book by declaring, among other things, that markets are conversations; and Stephen Jay Gould\'s use of the term hecatomb to explain evolution\'s remorseless pruning of failed mutations., Maker spaces are popping up all over where people can go and work with tools of all sorts, from woodworking to advanced 3D printers, to make things for themselves or prototype designs to manufacture. Seattle has been bereft of a large-scale facility with everything under one roof \xe2\x80\x94 until now. Ellie and Mike Kemery have just opened Makerhaus, a 10,000-square-foot building chock full of everything makers need. But their secret sauce, they hope, is community and education among their members. We talk about what a maker space can mean to bring all the hardware, software, and people together in one place to make magic happen.This episode is the first in the series in which I talk to facilitators: firms set up to help artists and producers connect with an audience. I\'ll be talking more over the coming weeks to a mix of creators and these new kinds of intermediaries that help rather than hinder achieving one\'s goals and finding an audience., Tonya and Adam Engst have been disrupting publishing for 23 years, starting shortly after graduating Cornell University when they founded TidBITS, a Macintosh journal that is now the longest continuously produced Internet publication. The Engsts took the first online ad dollars (probably), founded a DRM-free ebook publisher nearly a decade ago, and love their readers. The couple discuss their two-decades-plus of insights, including their love/hate relationship with content management systems for publishing., Jim Coudal runs Coudal Partners, a small design firm in Chicago that crafts all sorts of things. More than a decade ago, the group decided to shift its business from mostly working for others to mostly working for themselves. Field Notes (with Aaron Draplin), The Deck advertising network, and Layer Tennis are some of the commercial and entertaining results. Field Notes is entirely a physical product ordered online; The Deck, a digital one that can\'t exist without a network of independent voices. We talk about these two extremes and taking your creativity into your own hands., Andrea Seabrook spent more than a decade at National Public Radio, and covered Congress for a good part of that time. She left NPR to start something of her own: DecodeDC, a podcast and syndicated radio program (on this very network) that cuts through the blandification of politics, and speaks the unvarnished truth that gets lost in the interest of presenting supposedly balanced viewpoints. Andrea is fair, but she doesn\'t shrink from cutting through layer after layer of spin, something that\'s typically not possible in conventional broadcast media. We talk about the future of public radio and the joy of making your own decisions about what your audience wants to hear., Mark Frauenfelder likes to celebrate and encourage creativity in every form. He\'s the founder of BoingBoing, a directory of wonderful things that\'s encouraged "happy mutants" for over 15 years (and was a zine created with his wife, Carla Sinclair, before that), and the editor of Make Magazine, one of the inspirations of and driving forces behind the maker movement. Mark\'s book Made by Hand documents how he turned to raising chickens, growing food, and pulling espresso as a counterpart to his increasingly digitally focused life. We talk about the revival of people\'s interest in making things and collaborating with others in communities, as well as his book and Make magazine., Evan Ratliff is cofounder, CEO, and editor of The Atavist, a monthly magazine of long-form, non-fiction journalism, and, more recently, a platform (called just "Atavist") for other publications and organizations to use to publish stories to many destinations: the Web, mobile apps, EPUB for e-readers, and beyond. We talk about both aspects of the operation and what led the magazine to build its own content-management and publishing system, and then to turn around and resell that as a product. (We spoke just before the magazine part of The Atavist added a subscription option to its iOS app.), Tony Konecny, better known as Tonx, has been sourcing and roasting beans for a numbers of years, and recently founded Tonx Coffee, a subscription service that delivers whole beans from small batch roasting every two weeks. It\'s not a bean of the month club. It\'s a way to bypass the overchoice that one can face in specialty coffee shops, and get the assurance that the beans are fresh and good every time. In this episode, listen to Tonx and his ecommerce guru Nik Bauman talk about the joys of coffee and the joys of starting a business in which you can talk directly to your customers without anyone else getting in the way. There\'s a brief interlude in which the host and a friend have a little Tonx tasting, too.(Note: Although Tonx Coffee has sponsored other Mule Radio shows, this show is editorially independent and Tonx Coffee didn\'t sponsor this episode.), Chris Anderson was the editor in chief of Wired Magazine for over a decade, during which time he wrote an "accidental" trilogy of three books: The Long Tail, Free, and Makers. His latest book details how a mild obsession with do-it-yourself drones (pilotless planes) sucked him into the maker community, and to co-found a business now producing millions in sales. We talk about the maker movement, the revolution of atoms that\'s underway, and his drones. (He left Wired just after we recorded this podcast to work full-time as chief of his business, 3D Robotics.) , Filmmakers Lisanne Pajot and James Swirsky discovered the rich stories behind independently produced videogames, and turned some preliminary interviews into first one Kickstarter campaign, and then another. The resulting film, "Indie Game: The Movie," won an award at the Sundance Film Festival in early 2012. But then, rather than accept deals for conventional film distribution, the two organized their own tour, renting theatres and meeting Kickstarter backers around North America. They ultimately controlled their own digital distribution as well. We discuss their journey of the last two years, which remains underway as they ready special features., Welcome to a podcast that dives into how new ways creative people to fund, manufacture and produce, and distribute digital and physical goods to audiences they previously couldn\'t reach. The New Disruptors is about profound changes in the economy for making things. Listen to a brief introduction.]'

Diving into how brands can manage disruption through a whirlwind tour of products from cameras to watches to cars., Horace and Anders analyze the possible business models for Apple Watch, how it may be introduced, distributed, sold, and bought.

And yet we seek immortality, or at least life extending technologies. What are the possibilities and implications of a salubrious app? Is life extension the next killer app?, How and why does Apple get paid for Apple Pay?

We also look at the relatively unreported news regarding China lifting its 13-year ban on game consoles and the variables it introduces to a "big niche" industry., With new ChromeOS and Chromebook data, Horace returns us to the topic of Google. How do they define and view their customers, products, and businesses? Who actually serves whom? What user data is collected, how is it used, and why?, Horace and Mois\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9s discuss iPhone\'s move onto China Mobile and the long-brewing implications. They dig into how Apple\'s potential reach dwarfs that of Google, Facebook, and Amazon combined in the People\'s Republic, and look back briefly on 2013., Horace and Mois\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9s discuss the sudden decline of Bitcoin due to a crackdown in China, from the purpose of Bitcoin\'s existence to the nature and concept of a functional currency. What do we hire currency to do?, Horace unpacks the rumored, denied, and seemingly inevitable arrival of iPhone on China Mobile. Reflecting on smartphone adoption in the US, where does the unconventional logic take us from here?, Fresh off of back-to-back AirShows, Horace discusses the future of his "cinematographic" presentation style and announces Airshow World Tour.

How to measure "performance" of a medium via the median age of the audience and how that affects the advertiser\'s calculus., The fascination with highly visible but largely unknown business models continues. How do infomercials work? What is the value of fashion? How can you make money when no creative idea can be protected? Why is Apple building a sapphire manufacturing facility? It\'s all part of a pattern., The closing of one and the onset of another era. In this hundredth episode of The Critical Path we look back to some of the big questions we asked and ask them again with hindsight and foresight. They are:1. What happens to entertainment in the era of pervasive connectivity and computing?2. What happens to privacy when citizenship requires divulging all your secrets to commercial entities?3. What happens to the structure of computing when diffusions of innovations are instantly global?, In the wake of Apple\'s final announcement event of the year, Horace and Mois\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9s discuss the cost of free software, the unification of file formats, and the cost/benefit of interoperability., Horace and Mois\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9s look beyond Apple\'s rumored "watch" project to contemplate the real reasoning behind recent executive acquisitions from the world of high fashion (and what it signals). Is Apple now driving "lifestyle" more forcefully than ever? We examine redefinition, from public face to product, and Mac Pro to (possibly) iPod nano., Horace discusses AirShow NYC and his appearance on Bloomberg Surveillance, alongside blockbuster opening weekend sales of 9 million iPhone 5s/c units. We look ahead to what else Apple may have in store through sustaining and disruptive innovation., Relative to Apple\'s iPhone 5c/s introduction, we extrapolate the implications of their "most forward-looking phone" by examining product against price point, feature set, and the mysterious possibilities within iPhone that Apple has yet to unlock., A special episode in three parts: 1) Too many variables: The mechanics of the Microsoft Nokia deal 2) Climbing Everest without oxygen: The implications for Microsoft and 3) Post-abyss: The implications for Nokia., We begin with a defense of Ballmer for preserving great things, continue by condemning him for not having destroyed those very same things and end by asking whether anyone could have done the right thing., Markets are expected to do one thing and one thing only: determine price. What happens when they fail? The tragedy and comedy of corporate raiders. Also more on Airshow New York., Horace talks about Microsoft\'s reorganization from Divisional to Functional, and the implications on their Windows and Mobile OS roadmaps. In doing so, he and Mois\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9s touch briefly on the subject of last episode, Scott Forstall\'s ouster from Apple., Horace expands on last episode\'s discussion of organizational structure, as well as his recent appearance on Screen Time with Guy English. We begin speculation on the job iWatch would be hired to do, and preview the relaunch of High Density., Horace investigates asymmetric organization structure, and how Apple\'s functional vision of careers and jobs differ from most tech companies., Horace reflects on his analysis of iTunes purchase data, details the just-announced AirShow in Chicago, and touches on fascinating "heat maps" of mobile platform use. We close our week of three shows by talking about "deep focus" and Citizen Kane., In the second part of our WWDC wrapup, we delve into the large-scale shift represented by iOS 7.

Also a new mini-installment on "Asymcar", what\'s wrong with cars?, This week we cover a bit of Facebook Home, a bit of YouTuber economics, the best analogy ever heard for Google\'s business model, and we kick off Auto industry analysis with the "Five Whys"-the paradoxical questions that nobody seems to be asking about cars., Youtubers, BlackBerries and what Facebook is planning with their "Home on Android". Horace and Mois\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9s discuss how co-branding, strategy, and secret deals intertwine, with illustrations from Intel, Sony-Ericsson, and Acura, The more we deconstruct and take apart iTunes, the more we come to respect how it cannot exist independent of the system it\'s a part of. Its scope and scale and its history and future all indicate that there is more to it than just a store and that it might be a platform in its own right. We get into some more details about all these details and talk about where it came from and where we think it will end up., Beginning with the data on activations, we traverse the strategic implications of a shift in Android governance and management. Along the way we also cover Samsung\'s marketing strategy, budget, and the Galaxy S4 launch., New data allows us to estimate the components of iTunes with more precision.

That plus announcing a new 5by5 show: High Density., A dialogue with Benedict Evans, mobile analyst. Benedict has observed not only the technology and telecommunications industries as an equities analyst but also worked for an operator and a major media company. We take a look at mobile strategy and what the media industry will evolve into., Horace and Mois\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9s talk about the consequences of Samsung\'s absorption of all Android profits, the limits of iPhone\'s addressable market, Apple bear markets and, like an object in orbit, how Apple seems to always be falling but never hits Earth. Finally, Horace introduces Asymconf California., In this episode Horace and Mois\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9s discuss the iPad mini launch weekend (vis-a-vis older iPads and Windows 8), the curious case of choosy late adopters of smartphones in the US and the mystery of Apple\'s capex late in the year. Horace spins a yarn about how Apple is playing chess with Sharp and Foxconn (and others) vs. Samsung., Horace interviews Maxwell Wessel, fellow at Clay Christensen\'s Forum for Growth and Innovation at Harvard Business School. We explore the notion of apps as a disruption for multiple industries, especially entertainment., Horace and Mois\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9s discuss Apple\'s recent announcements, Horace\'s trip to Taiwan, and an Asymco special announcement. They also analyze claims that Apple has stopped innovating, and look ahead to where Apple\'s "puck" is going., Horace talks to Jean-Louis Gass\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9e about the early years of personal computing from 1968 to 1991. Covering his early roles at HP, Exxon Office Systems and his years at Apple, the story takes us back to a time and place that seems so distant and yet so familiar., Horace and his new regular co-host Mois\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9s Chiullan (5by5\'s Screen Time) discuss composing presentations on an iPad while on the road and, at long last, the completion of the Critical Path book.

How do we stay focused on fundamentals when it comes to analyzing Apple\'s stock price? What will it take to get Horace to use App.Net again?, A conversation with Philip Elmer-Dewitt on Apple\'s relationship with the media. How did the relationship evolve, is it changing and how is Apple addressing different media channels.

In doing so, they examine the native app vs. HTML5 debate., Horace and Mois\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9s discuss this week\'s Apple announcements, and implications as to where Apple goes from here, along with the rest of the industry., Horace is still out crossing the globe on secret missions, so Mois\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9s Chiullan, host of Screen Time, fills in for Dan.

In this episode, Horace follows up on last week\'s predictions now that the Apple v. Samsung verdict has been finalized ... or has it? Horace and Mois\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9s also dig into the algebra needed to decode how many tablet units which manufacturers have sold, and what that means for Amazon\'s Kindle Fire in particular., We cover three topics: 1. Safety and air travel: the bases of performance that don\'t get credit 2. The unintended consequences of litigation: US v. Microsoft and lessons learned for Apple v. Samsung 3. Product Portfolio theory: is focus impossible for everyone but Apple?, The crumbs of data falling off the Samsung v. Apple trial table get some scrutiny. Horace expands on some of the hints from the partial release of information and then continues with a discussion of how market data is collected and whether it should be trusted. That leads to a question of whether private (or paid) analysis is "better" than public (and unpaid). The benefits of having access to the vastness of collaborators online and the public sources of info might be tipping the balance. Finally, we talk about how big ideas go from sounding impossible to being inevitable and who gets rewarded for making them so., Horace takes another look at the aviation industry and asks whatever happened to air taxis. Then we go back to the manufacturing miracle of WWII in order to ask what might be the limits to growth. That helps us describe the "top down" opportunity for iOS and mobile computing in general looking at the overall mobile phone market. Finally Dan asks what are the qualifications needed for an analyst to perform wide-ranging reviews of industries., We turn our attention to the notion of competition. It\'s a concept that has many contradictory connotations. What we anticipate as sporting or fair is never the way business or war is conducted. How should you think about this and why does it matter in every decision you make professionally and personally?, This episode is recorded on the day after Apple\'s second quarter earnings release. We go through all the income statement updates and discuss what went wrong (almost everything) and what went right (precious little).

Putting aside some of the missed opportunities or bad timings, the quarter is reviewed as less than the stellar performance we\'ve become accustomed to but not bad all things considered., Dan and Horace cover the valuation question regarding Apple and tech in general as seen through investors\' eyes.

Horace takes two reader questions: How did Samsung succeed while other vendors failed with Android and what are the pitfalls that could cause Apple to stumble., Horace and Dan look at Microsoft\'s Surface through disruption colored lenses. First, the ongoing evolution of the computing value chain and how it foretold us of Surface. Second, how the economics of Microsoft\'s businesses makes Surface compelling. We also begin a new segment tentatively called "Reader Questions". This time it\'s education: is it disruptable? If so how can we tell and where will it lead us?, Having just returned from China, Horace gives his impressions which leads to a discussion about industrialization and innovation and how countries "mature" and what is Apple doing in China and the new relationship between Apple and strategic partnerships and the new stats from WWDC 2012 about developer revenues and how that differs from Android and the 400 million Android devices activated vs. 400 million iOS devices built, in China., Dan and Horace talk about the distinction between what Facebook is and what its value is perceived to be. We touch on both the opportunities and the challenges for social media and how these are reflected in the IPO. We note how and why Facebook integration in iOS might happen. Horace has a few words about China, WWDC, and the future of apps on TVs. It\'s all about context., This week, Horace follows up on his discussion of automobiles and road infrastructure by talking about how road networks were rebuilt in European countries to accommodate cycling. That leads to hints about the challenge of re-building energy infrastructure to support new power train technologies. Finally He and Dan also analyze comments made by Tim Cook at the recent D10 conference about Apple TV and disruption of the entertainment industry., Dan and Horace take a nostalgic trip through the automotive industry. Horace asks why should a 20 year old car (which he happens to own) be replaced? Why are cars built to be disposed of and why aren\'t they meaningfully improved based on new jobs to be done? In this episode we look at the auto industry as a proxy for other "network-based" industries which reach plateaus of innovation and can go no further. Plus, Horace challenges readers to guess what car he drives., Horace and Dan wade into Android Economics expanding on the series of posts on Asymco. We also give an update on The Critical Path Kickstarter project., Horace and Dan talk about how the Critical Path (The First Year) ebook Kickstarter project began, and hint at an upcoming topic: how to analyze the Android market., Horace interviews his teacher Clay Christensen to discuss his new book, How Will You Measure Your Life.

Horace describes the fascinating "lost tapes" of Steve Jobs and Nokia\'s latest anticlimactic results., Dan and Horace are back to discuss the latest news from Nokia, RIM, HTC and Sony and what they have to do with each other. We touch on the distinction between market and product orientation and meander into the question of what is the value of the enterprise vis-a-vis the product it sells and what management has meant and what it should mean. We even tackle the history (and future) of history., Horace talks again with Dan Abrams about film budgeting, Kickstarter, pre-production, location, technology for production, and a surprise announcement. We also discuss the project-oriented nature of movie production vis-a-vis "pipelined" product development, the history of studios and how they evolved, Pixar and much. much more., Horace talks to Mike Schneider, a feature film development executive about what development means in the context of filmmaking.

Dan also talks about his upcoming mockumentary about the Global Financial Crisis (www.falseprofitthemovie.com)., iPads and what we\'ll hire them to do for us. We talk about how measurements of the market show an unprecedented growth in mobile computing and how that leads to a new context for computing along axes of non-consumption. That could mean that the devices will become powerful enough to allow most people to be creative and reach self-realization., Act I: An analysis of the manufacturing cost structure for iPhonesAct II: The $10 billion App store economy and how to quantify value of apps per iPhone Act III: Like GM and IBM, rather than seeing it as the exception, Apple may be the rule that defines an era., We take a look at Mountain Lion as evidence that Apple is cross-pollinating its product lines. We look at the Apple stores as a service brand and Horace tips his hand ever so slightly about Asymconf., We talk about Apple\'s fourth quarter, Horace\'s trip to California and his visit to Colbert Report. It\'s all leading up to a fusion of entertainment and technology to create something never seen before. Something wonderful., Horace talks to Prof. Bill Torgerson from St. John\'s University about the writing process and how it survives and/or thrives as a commercial enterprise. We touch on writing for movies and compare the collaborative process of "content creation" vs. the "single voice" of an author. If you make software you really should pay attention to how art is made. And vice versa., Horace announces Asymconf and takes an archaeological expedition into the ancient history of personal computing so we can understand the distant future., Continuing our discussion of the creative side of Hollywood accounting, Dan and Horace take on the way income from movies is distributed and why no movies ever make money. The observations sharpen focus on the over-arching influence distribution has on the creative process., Horace and Dan begin a journey through the financial carnival that is Hollywood and talk about the wonders they encounter., Horace talks with Bob Moesta, a pioneer of Job To be Done research. We go over the theory and process of understanding what products are really hired to do and ask why this understanding is so hard to come by. In a discussion rich with examples from multiple industries Bob illustrates how marketing, design and engineering are all dancing around the question of how product should be developed. Could the universally accepted compartmentalization of corporate functions be a root cause to product failure?, Dan and Horace ponder why some companies are more mysterious than others. We ask whether transparency and simplicity of business models is a sign of strength or weakness. We compare the measurement, creation and capture of value and why we should celebrate the mortality of businesses., Horace interviews James Allworth, author, Fellow at the Forum for Growth and Innovation at Harvard Business School, and a former Apple employee. James describes what it\'s like working with Clayton Christensen and takes us on a journey through the latest academic and applied research being conducted on the theories of disruptive innovation., Horace interviews Dan Benjamin on the motivation, basis of competition and trajectory of the 5by5 network. By studying where podcasting came from and where it\'s going we provide proof of existence of disruption in "big media"., Horace talks to actor Hoon Lee about the challenges of disrupting the creative arts in general, and theater in particular.  By observing the changes in the performing arts we look to how mainstream media will change in response to technological and economic pressures., In the first of the Critical Path Interviews, Horace discusses the disruptive potential of cloud computing with Randy Bias.

We also discuss why some industries seem to be exempt from disruptive innovation and suggest that there are boundaries societies set to value re-definition., Dan and Horace talk about the tension between relying on data and using intuition to make strategy decisions. We also apply this dual approach to think through the next evolution of user interaction and the jobs we might hire mobile computers to do for us., Dan and Horace talk about patents and litigation as a means of defending innovation. We go way back to the beginning of the last century and talk how patent wars have played out in the past and how they affected the fortunes and fates of innovators., Dan and Horace talk about Apple\'s quarter with an eye toward the operational commitments being made.

aS'Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the history of ideas - including topics  drawn from philosophy, science, history, religion and culture., The female pharaoh Hatshepsut ruled Egypt in the early 15th century BC and some scholars argue that she was one of the most successful and influential pharaohs. Hatshepsut reasserted Egyptian power by building up international trade and commissioned buildings considered masterpieces of Egyptian architecture. She also made significant changes to the ideology surrounding the pharaoh and the gods. However, following her death, her name was erased from the records and her image obliterated. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Elizabeth Frood, Associate Professor of Egyptology at the University of Oxford; Kate Spence, Lecturer in Egyptian Archaeology at the University of Cambridge and Campbell Price, Curator of Egypt and Sudan at The Manchester Museum., Nuclear fusion is the process that powers stars. In the 1920s physicists predicted that it might be possible to generate huge amounts of energy by fusing atomic nuclei together, a reaction requiring enormous temperatures and pressures. Scientists have achieved fusion in the laboratory and today it is seen as a possible future source of limitless and clean energy. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Philippa Browning, Professor of Astrophysics at the University of Manchester; Steve Cowley, Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority and Justin Wark, Professor of Physics and fellow of Trinity College at the University of Oxford., The Haitian Revolution was an uprising in the French colony of St Domingue in 1791. Partly a consequence of the French Revolution and partly a backlash against the brutality of slave owners, it turned into a complex struggle involving not just the island\'s residents but French, English and Spanish forces. By 1804 the former slaves had won, establishing the first independent state in Latin America. But the revolution also created one of the world\'s most impoverished societies. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Kate Hodgson, Postdoctoral Research Fellow in French at the University of Liverpool; Tim Lockley, Reader in American Studies at the University of Warwick and Karen Salt, Fellow in History in the School of Language and Literature at the University of Aberdeen., Rudyard Kipling was born in Bombay in 1865 and has been described as the poet of Empire, celebrated for fictional works including Kim and The Jungle Book. Today his poem \'If\' remains one of the best known in the English language. He was the first British recipient of a Nobel Prize for Literature and a literary celebrity of the Edwardian era.  His work for the Commonwealth War Graves Commission played a major role in Britain\'s cultural response to the First World War. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Howard Booth, Senior Lecturer in English at the University of Manchester; Daniel Karlin, Winterstoke Professor of English Literature at the University of Bristol and Jan Montefiore, Professor of Twentieth Century English Literature at the University of Kent., The Battle of Talas was a significant encounter between Arab and Chinese forces in central Asia in 751 AD. It brought together two mighty empires, the Abbasid Caliphate and the Tang Dynasty, and although not well known today, the battle had profound consequences for the future of both civilisations. The Arabs won the confrontation, but the battle marks the point where the Islamic Empire halted its march eastwards, and the Chinese stopped their expansion to the west. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Hilde de Weerdt, Professor of Chinese History at Leiden University; Michael H\xc3\x83\xc2\xb6ckelmann, British Academy Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of History at King\'s College London and Hugh Kennedy, Professor of Arabic at SOAS, University of London., Julius Caesar was famously assassinated as he entered the Roman senate on the Ides of March, 44 BC. He was an inspirational general who conquered much of Europe, and a ruthless and canny politician who became dictator of Rome. He also wrote The Gallic Wars, one of the most admired and studied works of Latin literature. Shakespeare is one of many later writers to have been fascinated by the figure of Julius Caesar. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Christopher Pelling, Regius Professor of Greek at the University of Oxford; Catherine Steel, Professor of Classics at the University of Glasgow and Maria Wyke, Professor of Latin at University College London., Euler\'s number, also known as e, was first discovered in the 17th century by the Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli when he was studying compound interest. e is now recognised as one of the most important and interesting numbers in mathematics. Roughly equal to 2.718, e is useful in studying many everyday situations, from personal savings to epidemics. It also features in Euler\'s Identity, sometimes described as the most beautiful equation ever written. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Colva Roney-Dougal, Reader in Pure Mathematics at the University of St Andrews; June Barrow-Green, Senior Lecturer in the History of Maths at the Open University and Vicky Neale, Whitehead Lecturer at the Mathematical Institute and Balliol College at the University of Oxford., How was the Sun formed, and what do we know about its structure and the processes going on inside our nearest star?  With Carolin Crawford, Gresham Professor of Astronomy and Fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge; Yvonne Elsworth, Professor of Helioseismology at the University of Birmingham; and Louise Harra, Professor of Solar Physics at UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory., Virginia Woolf\'s novel Mrs Dalloway, first published in 1925, charts a single day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway, a prosperous member of London society, as she prepares to throw a party. Woolf explained in her diary what she had set out to do: \'I want to give life and death, sanity and insanity. I want to criticize the social system, and to show it at work at its most intense.\' Celebrated for its innovative narrative technique and distillation of many of the preoccupations of 1920s Britain, Mrs Dalloway is now seen as a landmark of 20th-century fiction, and one of the finest products of literary modernism. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Professor Dame Hermione Lee, President of Wolfson College, Oxford; Jane Goldman, Reader in English Literature at the University of Glasgow and Kathryn Simpson, Senior Lecturer in English Literature at Cardiff Metropolitan University., Hildegard of Bingen was one of the most remarkable figures of the Middle Ages. The abbess of a Benedictine convent, she experienced a series of mystical visions which she documented in her writings. She was celebrated for her wide-ranging scholarship, which covered theology, science and medicine. Officially recognised as a saint in 2012, Hildegard is also one of the earliest known composers. Since their rediscovery in recent decades her compositions have been widely recorded and performed. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Miri Rubin, Professor of Medieval and Early Modern History and Head of the School of History at Queen Mary, University of London; William Flynn, Lecturer in Medieval Latin at the Institute for Medieval Studies at the University of Leeds and Almut Suerbaum, Professor of Medieval German and Fellow of Somerville College, Oxford., The state of being alone can arise for many different reasons: imprisonment, exile or personal choice. It can be prompted by religious belief, personal necessity or a philosophical need for solitary contemplation. Many thinkers have dealt with the subject, from Plato and Aristotle to Hannah Arendt. It\'s a philosophical tradition that takes in medieval religious mystics, the work of Montaigne and Adam Smith, and the great American poets of solitude Thoreau and Emerson. With Melissa Lane, Professor of Politics at Princeton University; Simon Blackburn, Professor of Philosophy at the New College of the Humanities and Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge; and John Haldane,\rProfessor of Philosophy at the University of St Andrews., Robert Boyle was a pioneering scientist and a founder member of the Royal Society. Born in Ireland in 1627, Boyle was one of the first natural philosophers to conduct rigorous experiments, laid the foundations of modern chemistry and derived Boyle\'s Law, describing the physical properties of gases. In addition to his experimental work he left a substantial body of writings about philosophy and religion; his piety was one of the most important factors in his intellectual activities, prompting a celebrated dispute with his contemporary Thomas Hobbes. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Simon Schaffer, Professor of the History of Science at the University of Cambridge; Michael Hunter, Emeritus Professor of History at Birkbeck College, University of London and Anna Marie Roos, Senior Lecturer in the History of Science and Medicine at the University of Lincoln., The Bluestockings were a small group of intellectual women in the 18th century who met regularly to discuss literature and other matters. They invited some of the leading thinkers of the day to take part in their informal salons. In an age when women were not expected to be highly educated, the Bluestockings were sometimes regarded with suspicion or even hostility. But prominent members such as Elizabeth Montagu and the classicist Elizabeth Carter were highly regarded for their scholarship. Their accomplishments led to far greater acceptance of women as the intellectual equal of men, and furthered the cause of female education. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Karen O\'Brien, Vice-Principal and Professor of English at King\'s College London; Elizabeth Eger, Reader in English Literature at King\'s College London and Nicole Pohl, Reader in English Literature at Oxford Brookes University., The Talmud is one of the most important texts of Judaism. It was probably written down over a period of several hundred years, beginning in the 2nd century. It contains the authoritative text of the traditional Jewish oral law, and also an account of early Rabbinic discussions of these laws. In later centuries scholars wrote important commentaries on these texts, which remain central to most strands of modern Judaism. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Philip Alexander, Emeritus Professor of Jewish Studies at the University of Manchester; Rabbi Norman Solomon, Former Lecturer at the Oxford Centre for Jewish and Hebrew Studies and Laliv Clenman, Lecturer in Rabbinic Literature at Leo Baeck College and a Visiting Lecturer at KCL., The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, published in 1859, was a poem by Edward FitzGerald that was based on the verses of the 11th-century Persian scholar Omar Khayyam. Not a single copy was sold in the first few months after the work\'s publication, but after it came to the notice of members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood it became enormously influential. The Rubaiyat made Khayyam the best-known Eastern poet in the English-speaking world and FitzGerald\'s version is one of the most admired works of Victorian literature. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Charles Melville, Professor of Persian History at the University of Cambridge; Daniel Karlin, Winterstoke Professor of English Literature at the University of Bristol and Kirstie Blair, Professor of English Studies at the University of Stirling., Photosynthesis is the process by which plants and many other organisms use sunlight to produce organic molecules. Photosynthesis arose early in evolutionary history and has been a crucial driver of life on Earth. In addition to providing most of the food on the planet, it is also responsible for maintaining atmospheric oxygen levels, and is thus almost certainly the most important chemical process ever discovered. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Nick Lane, Reader in Evolutionary Biochemistry at University College London; Sandra Knapp, Botanist at the Natural History Museum and John Allen, Professor of Biochemistry at Queen Mary, University of London., The Sino-Japanese War of 1937-45 broke out after several years of rising tension between China and Japan. When the Japanese invaded China they met with fierce resistance, despite internal Chinese political divisions. Once the USA had entered the war following the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the Japanese found themselves fighting on several fronts and finally capitulated in August 1945. This notoriously brutal conflict left millions dead and had far-reaching consequences for Asia. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Rana Mitter, Professor of the History and Politics of Modern China at the University of Oxford; Barak Kushner, Senior Lecturer in Japanese History at the University of Cambridge and Tehyun Ma, Lecturer in Chinese History at the University of Exeter., The Tale of Sinuhe is one of the most celebrated works of ancient Egyptian literature. Written about 4000 years ago, the poem narrates the story of an Egyptian official who is exiled to Syria-Palestine before returning to his homeland many years later. Although the story is set against a backdrop of real historical events, most scholars believe that the poem is a work of fiction. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Richard Parkinson, Professor of Egyptology and Fellow of Queen\'s College at the University of Oxford; Roland Enmarch, Senior Lecturer in Egyptology at the University of Liverpool and Aidan Dodson, Senior Research Fellow in the Department of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of Bristol., Laurence Sterne\'s novel Tristram Shandy is an extravagantly inventive work which was hugely popular when first published in 1759. Its often bawdy humour and numerous digressions are combined with bold literary experiment, such as a page printed entirely black to mark the death of one of the novel\'s characters. Two hundred and fifty years after the book\'s publication, Tristram Shandy remains one of the most influential and widely admired books of the 18th century. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Judith Hawley, Professor of Eighteenth-Century Literature at Royal Holloway, University of London; John Mullan, Professor of English at University College London and Mary Newbould, Bowman Supervisor in English at Wolfson College, University of Cambridge., The Domesday Book of 1086 was a vast survey of much of the land and property of England and Wales. Twenty years after the Battle of Hastings, William the Conqueror sent officials to gather information about settlements, the people who lived there, their land holdings and even their farm animals. The resulting document was of immense importance for many centuries, and remains a central source for medieval historians. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Stephen Baxter, Reader in Medieval History at Kings College London; Elisabeth van Houts, Honorary Professor of Medieval European History at the University of Cambridge and David Bates, Professorial Fellow in Medieval History at the University of East Anglia., Strabo\'s Geographica, written almost 2000 years ago by a Greek scholar, is an ambitious attempt to describe the entire world known to the Romans and Greeks at that time. One of the earliest systematic works of geography, Strabo\'s book offers a revealing insight into ancient scholarship, and remained influential for many centuries after the author\'s death. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Paul Cartledge, AG Leventis Professor of Greek Culture at the University of Cambridge; Maria Pretzler, Senior Lecturer in Ancient History at Swansea University and Benet Salway, Senior Lecturer in Ancient History at UCL., The states in which matter can exist is a fascinating area of scientific enquiry. Most people are familiar with the idea that a substance like water can exist in solid, liquid and gaseous forms. But as much as 99% of the matter in the universe is now believed to exist in a fourth state, plasma. Today scientists recognise a number of other exotic states, such as glass, gels and liquid crystals - many of them with useful properties. Melyvn Bragg is joined by Andrea Sella, Professor of Chemistry at University College London; Athene Donald, Professor of Experimental Physics at the University of Cambridge and Justin Wark, Professor of Physics and Fellow of Trinity College at the University of Oxford., Max Weber\'s book the Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, published in 1905, proposed that Protestantism had been a significant factor in the emergence of capitalism. He made an explicit connection between religious ideas and economic systems. Weber suggested that Calvinism, with its emphasis on personal asceticism and the merits of hard work, had created an ethic which had enabled the success of capitalism in Protestant countries. Weber\'s essay has come in for some criticism since he published the work, but it is still seen as one of the seminal texts of 20th-century sociology. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Peter Ghosh, Fellow in History at St Anne\'s College, Oxford; Sam Whimster, Honorary Professor in Sociology at the University of New South Wales and Linda Woodhead, Professor of Sociology of Religion at Lancaster University., George Berkeley, an Anglican bishop, was one of the most important philosophers of the 18th century. Bishop Berkeley believed that objects only truly exist in the mind of somebody who perceives them - an idea he called immaterialism. His work on the nature of perception was a spur to many later thinkers, including Hume and Kant. The clarity of Berkeley\'s writing, and his ability to pose a problem in an easily understood form, has made him one of the most admired early modern thinkers. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Peter Millican, Gilbert Ryle Fellow and Professor of Philosophy at Hertford College, Oxford; Tom Stoneham, Professor of Philosophy at the University of York and Michela Massimi, Senior Lecturer in Philosophy of Science at the University of Edinburgh., The Trinity, the idea that God is a single entity but one known in three distinct forms (Father, Son and Holy Spirit), has been a central belief for most Christians since the earliest years of the religion. The doctrine was often controversial in the early Church, until clarified by the Council of Nicaea in the late 4th century. St Augustine and Thomas Aquinas recognised that this religious mystery posed profound theological questions. The Trinity\'s influence on Christian thought and practice is considerable, although it is interpreted in different ways by different Christian traditions. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Janet Soskice, Professor of Philosophical Theology at the University of Cambridge and a Fellow of Jesus College; Martin Palmer, Director of the International Consultancy on Religion, Education, and Culture, and The Reverend Graham Ward, Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Oxford and a Canon of Christ Church., Spartacus was the famous gladiator who led a major slave rebellion against the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC. An accomplished military leader, he was celebrated by some ancient historians and reviled by others. Later, in the 19th century, he became a hero to revolutionaries in Europe. Modern perceptions of his character have been influenced by Stanley Kubrick\'s 1960 film, but ancient sources give a more complex picture of Spartacus and the aims of his rebellion. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Mary Beard, Professor of Classics at the University of Cambridge; Maria Wyke, Professor of Latin at University College, London and Theresa Urbainczyk, Associate Professor of Classics at University College, Dublin., The eye has been the subject of research for at least 2500 years. Some ancient philosophers believed that the eye enabled creatures to see by emitting its own light. The function of the eye became an area of particular interest to doctors in the Islamic Golden Age. In Renaissance Europe the work of thinkers including Kepler and Descartes revolutionised thinking about how the organ worked, but it took several hundred years for the eye to be thoroughly understood. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Patricia Fara, Senior Tutor of Clare College, University of Cambridge; William Ayliffe, Gresham Professor of Physic at Gresham College and Robert Iliffe, Professor of Intellectual History and History of Science at the University of Sussex., Social Darwinism was the idea that Charles Darwin\'s theory about evolution, as set out in his masterpiece On the Origin of Species in 1859, could also be applied to human society. One thinker particularly associated with this movement was Herbert Spencer, who argued that competition among humans was beneficial, because it ensured that only the healthiest and most intelligent individuals would succeed. Social Darwinism remained influential for several decades, although its connection with eugenics and adoption as an ideological position by Fascist regimes ensured its eventual downfall from intellectual respectability. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Adam Kuper, Centennial Professor of Anthropology at the LSE, University of London; Gregory Radick, Professor of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Leeds and Charlotte Sleigh, Reader in the History of Science at the University of Kent., Chivalry was the moral code observed by knights of the Middle Ages. It originated in the military practices of aristocratic French and German soldiers, but developed into an elaborate system governing many different aspects of knightly behaviour. It influenced the conduct of military campaigns and gave rise to the phenomenon of courtly love, the subject of much romance literature, as well as to the practice of heraldry. The remnants of the chivalric tradition linger in European culture even today. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Miri Rubin, Professor of Medieval and Early Modern History and Head of the School of History at Queen Mary, University of London; Matthew Strickland, Professor of Medieval History at the University of Glasgow and Laura Ashe, Associate Professor in English at the University of Oxford and Fellow of Worcester College., The Phoenicians were an ancient people from the Levant who were accomplished sailors and traders, and are thought to have taught the Greeks their alphabet. By about 700 BC they were trading all over the Mediterranean, taking Egyptian and Syrian goods as far as Spain and North Africa. Although they left few records of their own, they were hugely influential in the ancient world. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Mark Woolmer, Assistant Principal at Collingwood College, Durham University; Josephine Quinn, Lecturer in Ancient History at the University of Oxford and Cyprian Broodbank, Professor of Mediterranean Archaeology at University College London., Catastrophism is the idea that natural disasters have had a significant influence in moulding the Earth\'s geological features. In 1822 William Buckland ascribed most of the fossil record to the effects of Noah\'s flood. Charles Lyell later challenged these writings, arguing that geological change was slow and gradual, and that the processes responsible could still be seen at work today - a theory known as Uniformitarianism. But in the 1970s the idea that catastrophes were a major factor in the Earth\'s geology was revived by the discovery of evidence of a giant asteroid impact 65 million years ago, believed by many to have caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Andrew Scott, Leverhulme Emeritus Fellow in the Department of Earth Sciences at Royal Holloway, University of London; Jan Zalasiewicz, Senior Lecturer in Geology at the University of Leicester and Leucha Veneer, Visiting Scholar at the Faculty of Life Sciences at the University of Manchester., The first records of historical events in China date from the Shang dynasty of the 2nd millennium BC. The earliest surviving records were inscribed on bones or tortoise shells; in later centuries, chroniclers left detailed accounts on paper or silk. In the last 100 years, archaeologists have discovered a wealth of new materials, including a cache of previously unknown texts which were found in a cave on the edge of the Gobi Desert. Such sources are shedding new light on Chinese history, although interpreting them presents a number of challenges. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Roel Sterckx, Joseph Needham Professor of Chinese History at the University of Cambridge; Tim Barrett, Professor of East Asian History at SOAS, University of London and Hilde de Weerdt, Professor of Chinese History at Leiden University., The Battle of Tours took place in 732 when a large Arab army invaded Gaul from northern Spain. They were defeated near Poitiers by Charles Martel and his Frankish forces. The result confirmed the regional supremacy of Charles, who went on to establish a strong Frankish dynasty. The Battle of Tours was the last major incursion of Muslim armies into northern Europe; some historians, including Edward Gibbon, have seen it as the decisive moment that determined that the continent would remain Christian. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Hugh Kennedy, Professor of Arabic at SOAS, University of London; Rosamond McKitterick, Professor of Medieval History at the University of Cambridge and Matthew Innes, Vice-Master and Professor of History at Birkbeck, University of London., Plato\'s Symposium is one of the Greek philosopher\'s most celebrated works. Written in the 4th century BC, it is a dialogue set at a dinner party attended by a number of prominent ancient Athenians, including the philosopher Socrates and the playwright Aristophanes. Each of the guests speaks of Eros, or erotic love. This fictional discussion of the nature of love, how and why it arises and what it means to be in love, has had a significant influence on later thinkers, and is the origin of the modern notion of Platonic love. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Angie Hobbs, Professor of the Public Understanding of Philosophy at the University of Sheffield; Richard Hunter, Regius Professor of Greek at the University of Cambridge and Frisbee Sheffield, Director of Studies in Philosophy at Christ\'s College, University of Cambridge., The Medici family dominated Florence\'s political and cultural life for three centuries. They came to prominence in Italy in the 15th century as a result of the wealth they built up through banking. With the rise of Cosimo de\' Medici, they became Florence\'s most powerful and influential dynasty, effectively controlling the city\'s government. Their patronage of the arts turned Florence into a leading centre of the Renaissance and the Medici Bank was one of the most successful institutions of its day. As well as producing four popes, members of the Medici married into various European royal families. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Evelyn Welch, Professor of Renaissance Studies at King\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s College, University of London; Robert Black, Professor of Renaissance History at the University of Leeds and Catherine Fletcher, Lecturer in Public History at the University of Sheffield., Complexity is a young discipline which can help us understand the world around us. When individuals come together and act in a group, they do so in complicated and unpredictable ways: societies often behave very differently from the people within them. Research into complex systems now has important applications in many different fields, from biology to political science. Today it is being used to explain how birds flock, to predict traffic flow in cities and to study the spread of diseases. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Ian Stewart, Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Warwick; Jeff Johnson, Professor of Complexity Science and Design at the Open University and Professor Eve Mitleton-Kelly, Director of the Complexity Research Group at the London School of Economics., Pliny the Younger was a prolific Roman letter-writer. A prominent lawyer in the 1st century AD, Pliny later became governor of the province of Bithynia, in modern Turkey. Pliny\'s letters offer fascinating insights into life and government in ancient Rome and its empire, from the mundane details of irrigation schemes to his vivid eyewitness account of the eruption of Vesuvius. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Catharine Edwards, Professor of Classics and Ancient History at Birkbeck, University of London; Roy Gibson, Professor of Latin at the University of Manchester and Alice K\xc3\x83\xc2\xb6nig, Lecturer in Latin and Classical Studies at the University of St Andrews., Hinduism has no single creation story. Throughout history, Hindu thinkers have taken a variety of approaches to the question of where we come from, with some making the case for divine intervention and others asking whether it is even possible for humans to comprehend the nature of creation. The origin of our existence, and the nature of the Universe we live in, is one of the richest strands of Hindu thought. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Jessica Frazier, Lecturer in Religious Studies at the University of Kent and a Research Fellow of the Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies at the University of Oxford; Chakravarthi Ram-Prasad, Professor of Comparative Religion and Philosophy at Lancaster University and Gavin Flood, Professor of Hindu Studies and Comparative Religion at the University of Oxford., The microscope has revolutionised our knowledge of the world and the organisms that inhabit it. Invented in the seventeenth century, the microscope became an essential component of scientific enquiry by the nineteenth century, but in the 1930s a German physicist, Ernst Ruska, discovered that by using a beam of electrons he could view structures much tinier than was possible using visible light. Today light and electron microscopy are among the most powerful tools at the disposal of modern science, and new techniques are still being developed., Pocahontas was a Native American woman who became a symbol of the New World to English eyes. During the colonisation of Virginia in the early 17th century, Pocahontas was captured by the English, converted to Christianity, married a settler and travelled to England where she was regarded as a curiosity. She died in 1617 aged 22 and was buried in Gravesend; her story has fascinated generations on both sides of the Atlantic and has been reinterpreted by many writers and artists. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Susan Castillo, Harriet Beecher Stowe Emeritus Professor of American Studies at King\'s College London; Tim Lockley, Reader in American Studies at the University of Warwick and Jacqueline Fear-Segal, Reader in American History and Culture at the University of East Anglia., The Tempest is thought to be one of Shakespeare\'s final works and contains some of his most poetic and memorable passages. It was influenced by accounts of distant lands written by contemporary explorers, and by the complex politics of the early Jacobean age. The play is set entirely on an unnamed island inhabited by the magician Prospero, his daughter Miranda and the monstrous Caliban, one of Shakespeare\'s most intriguing characters. Its themes include magic and the nature of theatre itself - and some modern critics have seen it as an early meditation on the ethics of colonialism. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Jonathan Bate, Provost of Worcester College, Oxford; Erin Sullivan, Lecturer and Fellow at the Shakespeare Institute, University of Birmingham and Katherine Duncan-Jones, Emeritus Fellow of Somerville College, Oxford., Ordinary Language Philosophy was a school of thought which emerged in Oxford in the years following World War II. With its roots in the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein, Ordinary Language Philosophy is concerned with the meanings of words as used in everyday speech. Its adherents believed that many philosophical problems were created by the misuse of words, and that if such \'ordinary language\' were correctly analysed, such problems would disappear. Philosophers associated with the school include some of the most distinguished British thinkers of the 20th century, such as Gilbert Ryle and JL Austin. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Stephen Mulhall, Professor of Philosophy at New College, Oxford; Ray Monk, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Southampton and Julia Tanney, Reader in Philosophy of Mind at the University of Kent., The Berlin Conference of 1884 brought together Europe\'s leading powers to discuss trade and territorial rights in Africa. It is widely seen as one of the most significant events in the process known as the Scramble for Africa, and the decisions reached had effects which have lasted to the present day. In the following decades, European nations laid claim to most of the continent. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Richard Drayton, Rhodes Professor of Imperial History at King\'s College London; Richard Rathbone, Emeritus Professor of African History at SOAS, University of London and Joanna Lewis, Assistant Professor of Imperial History at the LSE, University of London., The Corn Laws were passed by the British Government in 1815 to keep the price of corn artificially high. The measure was supported by landowners but strongly opposed by manufacturers and the urban working class. In the 1830s the Anti-Corn Law League was founded to campaign for their repeal. Robert Peel\'s Conservative government finally repealed the laws in 1846, splitting his party in the process. The resulting debate had profound consequences for the political and economic future of the country. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Lawrence Goldman, Fellow in Modern History at St Peter\'s College, Oxford; Boyd Hilton, Former Professor of Modern British History at the University of Cambridge and Fellow of Trinity College and Cheryl Schonhardt-Bailey, Reader in Political Science at the London School of Economics., The Book of Common Prayer, first published in 1549, contained versions of the liturgy in English. Compiled by Thomas Cranmer, the book was at the centre of the decade of religious turmoil that followed, and disputes over its use were one of the major causes of the English Civil War in the 1640s. The book was revised several times before the celebrated final version was published in 1662. It is still in use in many churches today, and remains not just a liturgical text of great importance but a literary work of profound beauty. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Diarmaid MacCulloch, Professor of the History of the Church at the University of Oxford; Alexandra Walsham, Professor of Modern History at the University of Cambridge and Martin Palmer, Director of the International Consultancy on Religion, Education, and Culture., Galen was the most celebrated doctor in the ancient world. Greek by birth, he spent most of his career in Rome, where he was personal physician to three Emperors. Acclaimed in his own lifetime, he was regarded as the preeminent medical authority for centuries after his death, both in the Arab world and in medieval Europe. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Vivian Nutton, Emeritus Professor of the History of Medicine at University College London; Helen King, Professor of Classical Studies at the Open University and Caroline Petit, Wellcome Trust Senior Research Fellow in Classics at the University of Warwick., Exoplanets are planets beyond our solar system. Astronomers have speculated about their existence for centuries, but it was not until the 1990s that instruments became sophisticated enough to detect such remote objects. Since then, more than 900 exoplanets have been discovered, and scientists are now able to reach increasingly sophisticated conclusions about what they look like - and whether they might be able to support life. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Carolin Crawford, Gresham Professor of Astronomy and a member of the Institute of Astronomy at the University of Cambridge; Don Pollacco,\rProfessor of Astronomy at the University of Warwick and Suzanne Aigrain, Lecturer in Astrophysics at the University of Oxford and a Fellow of All Souls College., The Mamluks ruled Egypt and Syria from 1250 to 1517. Originally slave soldiers who managed to depose their masters, they went on to repel the Mongols and the Crusaders to become the dominant force in the medieval Islamic world. Although the Mamluks were renowned as warriors, they were also great patrons of the arts. They remained in power for almost 300 years until they were finally overthrown by the Ottomans. Melvyn Bragg is joined by\rAmira Bennison, Reader in the History and Culture of the Maghrib at the University of Cambridge; Robert Irwin,\rFormer Senior Research Associate in the Department of History at SOAS, University of London and Doris Behrens-Abouseif, Nasser D Khalili Professor of Islamic Art and Archaeology at SOAS, University of London., Pascal was a brilliant 17th-century mathematician and scientist who invented one of the first mechanical calculators and made important discoveries about fluids and vacuums while still a young man. In his thirties he experienced a religious conversion, after which he devoted most of his attention to philosophy and theology. Although he died in his late thirties, Pascal left a formidable legacy as a scientist and pioneer of probability theory, and as one of seventeenth century Europe\'s greatest writers., In the early 1860s the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell derived four equations which together describe the behaviour of electricity and magnetism. They predicted the existence of a previously unknown phenomenon: electromagnetic waves. These waves were first observed in the early 1880s, and over the next two decades a succession of scientists and engineers built increasingly elaborate devices to produce and detect them. Eventually this gave birth to a new technology: radio. The Italian Guglielmo Marconi is commonly described as the father of radio - but many other figures were involved in its development, and it was not him but a Canadian, Reginald Fessenden, who first succeeded in transmitting speech over the airwaves. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Simon Schaffer,\rProfessor of the History of Science at the University of Cambridge; Elizabeth Bruton, Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Leeds and John Liffen,\rCurator of Communications at the Science Museum, London., Romance of the Three Kingdoms is widely regarded as one of the greatest works of Chinese literature. Written 600 years ago, it is an historical novel that tells the story of a tumultuous period in Chinese history when the Han Dynasty fell from power in the 3rd century AD. The influence of Romance of the Three Kingdoms in East Asia has been likened to that of Homer in the West, and this warfare epic remains popular in China today. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Frances Wood,\rFormer Lead Curator of Chinese Collections at the British Library; Craig Clunas, Professor of the History of Art at the University of Oxford and Margaret Hillenbrand, University Lecturer in Modern Chinese Literature at the University of Oxford and Fellow of Wadham College., The Physiocrats were an important group of economic thinkers in 18th-century France. They believed that the land was the ultimate source of all wealth and that markets should not be constrained by governments. Their ideas were important not just to economists but to the course of politics in France. Later they influenced the work of Adam Smith. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Richard Whatmore, Professor of Intellectual History &amp; the History of Political Thought at the University of Sussex; \rJoel Felix, Professor of History at the University of Reading and Helen Paul, Lecturer in Economics and Economic History at the University of Southampton., Prophecy has great meaning and significance in the Abrahamic religions. Prophets, those with the ability to convey divinely-inspired revelation, are significant figures in the Hebrew Bible and later became important not just to Judaism but also to Christianity and Islam. Although these three religions share many of the same prophets, their interpretation of the nature of prophecy often differs. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Mona Siddiqui, Professor of Islamic and Interreligious Studies at the University of Edinburgh; Justin Meggitt, University Senior Lecturer in the Study of Religion and the Origins of Christianity at the University of Cambridge and Jonathan St\xc3\x83\xc2\xb6kl, Post-Doctoral Researcher at Leiden University., Einstein\'s theories of relativity transformed our understanding of the Universe. The twin theories of Special and General Relativity offered insights into the nature of space, time and gravitation which changed the face of modern science. It\'s regarded today as one of the greatest intellectual achievements of the 20th century, and had an impact far beyond the world of science. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Ruth Gregory, Professor of Mathematics and Physics at Durham University; Martin Rees, Astronomer Royal and Emeritus Professor of Cosmology and Astrophysics at the University of Cambridge and Roger Penrose, Emeritus Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford., Queen Zenobia was a distinguished military leader of the ancient world. Born in about 240 AD, Zenobia became Empress of the Palmyrene Empire in the Middle East. She is renowned for launching a rebellion against the Roman Empire and conquering Egypt before being finally defeated by the Emperor Aurelian. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Edith Hall, Professor of Classics at King\'s College, London; \rKate Cooper, Professor of Ancient History at the University of Manchester and Richard Stoneman, Honorary Visiting Professor in the Department of Classics and Ancient History at the University of Exeter., Anthropologist Claude L\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9vi-Strauss was one of 20th-century France\'s most celebrated intellectuals. He set out to show in his work that human thought processes were universal, whether people lived in tribal rainforest societies or in the rich intellectual life of Paris. He was the leading exponent of structuralism, and his books about the nature of myth, thought and kinship are now seen as some of the most important anthropological texts. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Adam Kuper, Visiting Professor of Anthropology at Boston University; Christina Howells, Professor of French at Oxford University and Vincent Debaene, Associate Professor of French Literature at Columbia University., Cosmic rays were discovered in 1912 by the physicist Victor Hess. The Earth is under constant bombardment from this radiation coming from beyond our atmosphere. Cosmic rays can cause damage to satellites and electronic devices on Earth, but the study of cosmic rays has led to major breakthroughs in particle physics. Today physicists are still trying to establish where these highly energetic particles come from. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Carolin Crawford, Gresham Professor of Astronomy and a member of the Institute of Astronomy at the University of Cambridge; Alan Watson, \rEmeritus Professor of Physics at the University of Leeds and Tim Greenshaw, \rProfessor of Physics at the University of Liverpool., The Icelandic Sagas were first written down in the 13th century and tell the stories of the Norse settlers who began to arrive in Iceland 400 years before. They contain some of the richest and most extraordinary writing of the Middle Ages. Full of heroes, feuds, ghosts and outlaws, the sagas inspired later writers including Sir Walter Scott, William Morris and WH Auden. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Carolyne Larrington, Fellow and Tutor in Medieval English Literature at St John\'s College, Oxford; Elizabeth Ashman Rowe, University Lecturer in Scandinavian History at the University of Cambridge and Emily Lethbridge, Post-Doctoral Researcher at the \xc3\x83\xc2\x81rni Magn\xc3\x83\xc2\xbasson Manuscripts Institute in Reykjav\xc3\x83\xc2\xadk., Gnosticism was a belief system associated with early Christianity. Gnostics believed that a special hidden knowledge, or gnosis, would enable them to escape the evils of the physical world and reach the higher spiritual realm. The Gnostics were regarded as heretics by most of the early Church Fathers, but their influence was important in defining the course of Christianity. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Martin Palmer, Director of the International Consultancy on Religion, Education, and Culture; Caroline Humfress, Reader in History at Birkbeck College, University of London and Alastair Logan, Honorary University Fellow of the Department of Theology and Religion at the University of Exeter., Montaigne\'s Essays deal with an eclectic range of subjects, from the dauntingly weighty to the apparently trivial. Born in France in 1533, Montaigne is often seen as one of the most outstanding Sceptical thinkers of his time. His approachable style, intelligence and subtle thought have made him one of the most widely admired writers of the Renaissance. Melvyn Bragg is joined by David Wootton, Anniversary Professor of History at York University; Terence Cave, Emeritus Professor of French Literature at the University of Oxford and Felicity Green, Chancellor\'s Fellow in History at the University of Edinburgh., The Putney Debates took place in late 1647, after the defeat of King Charles I in the first English Civil War. Representatives of the New Model Army and the radical Levellers met in a Putney church to debate the future of England, who should be allowed to vote, civil liberties and religious freedom. Their debates had much influence on centuries of political thought. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Justin Champion, Professor of the History of Early Modern Ideas at Royal Holloway, University of London; Ann Hughes, Professor of Early Modern History at Keele University and Kate Peters, Fellow in History at Murray Edwards College, Cambridge., The Amazons were a mythical tribe of  female warriors who first appeared in Greek culture. In later centuries, particularly in the Renaissance, the Amazons became a popular theme of literature and art. After the discovery of the New World, the Amazon River was named after them. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Paul Cartledge,\rA.G. Leventis Professor of Greek Culture at Cambridge University; Chiara Franceschini, Teaching Fellow at University College London and an Academic Assistant at the Warburg Institute and Caroline Vout, Senior Lecturer in Classics and Fellow and Director of Studies at Christ\'s College, Cambridge., Japan\'s Sakoku period was a time when the country isolated itself from the Western world. It began with a series of edicts in the 1630s which restricted the rights of Japanese to leave their country and expelled most of the Europeans living there. Although historians used to think of Japan as completely isolated from external influence for the next 200 years, recent scholarship suggests that Japanese society was far less cut off from European ideas during this period than previously thought. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Richard Bowring,\rEmeritus Professor of Japanese Studies at the University of Cambridge; Andrew Cobbing, Associate Professor of History at the University of Nottingham and Rebekah Clements, Research Associate at the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Cambridge., The chemistry of the water molecule - Andrea Sella, Hasok Chang and Patricia Hunt join Melvyn Bragg to discuss one of the most fascinating substances on Earth., The biologist Alfred Russel Wallace was a pioneer of evolutionary theory. Born in 1823, he travelled extensively, charting the distribution of animal species throughout the world. In 1858 he sent his paper on the theory of evolution by natural selection to Charles Darwin, who was spurred into the publication of his own masterpiece On the Origin of Species. But despite his visionary work, Wallace has been overshadowed by the greater fame of Darwin. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Steve Jones, Emeritus Professor of Genetics at University College London; George Beccaloni, Director of the Wallace Correspondence Project at the Natural History Museum and Ted Benton,\rProfessor of Sociology at the University of Essex., Anton Chekhov, the 19th-century Russian writer, is perhaps best known for his plays including The Cherry Orchard and Three Sisters. He is also celebrated today as one of the greatest of short story writers. His works are often powerful character studies and chronicle the changing nature of Russian society. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Catriona Kelly, Professor of Russian at the University of Oxford; Cynthia Marsh, Emeritus Professor of Russian Drama and  Literature at the University of Nottingham and Rosamund Bartlett,\rFounding Director of the Anton Chekhov Foundation., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss absolute zero, the lowest conceivable temperature, about minus 273 degrees Celsius. At temperatures close to absolute zero, physicists have discovered a number of strange new phenomena including superfluids, liquids capable of climbing a vertical surface. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Simon Schaffer, Professor of the History of Science at the University of Cambridge; Stephen Blundell, Professor of Physics at the University of Oxford and Nicola Wilkin, Lecturer in Theoretical Physics at the University of Birmingham., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the life and work of the Victorian anthropologist and archaeologist Augustus Pitt-Rivers. He amassed thousands of ethnographic and archaeological objects, some of which formed the founding collection of the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford. Inspired by Charles Darwin, Pitt-Rivers believed that human technology evolved in the same way as living organisms. He was also a pioneering archaeologist who provided a model for later scholars. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Adam Kuper, Visiting Professor of Anthropology at Boston University; Richard Bradley, Professor in Archaeology at the University of Reading and Dan Hicks, University Lecturer &amp; Curator of Archaeology at the Pitt Rivers Museum at the University of Oxford., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss Evelyn Waugh\'s comic novel Decline and Fall. Set partly in a substandard boys\' public school, the novel is a vivid, often riotous portrait of 1920s Britain. Its themes, including modernity, religion and fashionable society, came to dominate Waugh\'s later fiction, and it was immediately celebrated for its vicious satire and biting humour. Melvyn Bragg is joined by David Bradshaw, Professor of English Literature at Worcester College, Oxford; John Bowen, Professor of Nineteenth-Century Literature at the University of York and Ann Pasternak Slater, Senior Research Fellow at St Anne\'s College, Oxford., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss ice ages, periods when ice sheets cover the Earth\'s Poles. Geological evidence indicates that there have been several in the Earth\'s history, although their precise cause is not known. Ice ages have had profound effects on the geography and biology of our planet. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Jane Francis, Professor of Paleoclimatology at the University of Leeds; Richard Corfield, Visiting Research Fellow in the Department of Earth Sciences at Oxford University and Carrie Lear, Senior Lecturer in Palaeoceanography at Cardiff University., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss Epicureanism, the philosophical system based on the teachings of Epicurus and founded in Athens in the 4th century BC. At the centre of his philosophy is the idea that the goal of human life is pleasure, by which he meant not luxury but the avoidance of pain. He also stressed the importance of friendship. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Angie Hobbs, Professor of the Public Understanding of Philosophy at the University of Sheffield; David Sedley, Laurence Professor of Ancient Philosophy at the University of Cambridge and James Warren, Reader in Ancient Philosophy at the University of Cambridge., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the War of 1812, the conflict between the USA and Britain sometimes referred to as the second American War of Independence. Although the War of 1812 is often overlooked, historians say it had a profound effect on the USA and Canada\'s sense of national identity, confirming the USA as an independent country. The war also led to Native Americans losing millions of acres of land in a programme of forced removal. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Kathleen Burk, Professor of Modern and Contemporary History at University College London; Lawrence Goldman, Fellow in Modern History at St Peter\'s College, University of Oxford and Frank Cogliano, Professor of American History at the University of Edinburgh., Melvyn Bragg is joined by Mary Beard, Tim Cornell and Peter Wiseman to discuss the story of Romulus and Remus, the foundation myth of Rome., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss comets, the \'dirty snowballs\' of the Solar System. Halley\'s Comet is today the best known example of a comet, a body of ice and dust which orbits the Sun. Since they contain materials from the time when the Solar System was formed, comets are regarded by scientists as frozen time capsules, with the potential to reveal important information about the early history of planets. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Monica Grady, Professor of Planetary and Space Sciences at the Open University; Paul Murdin, Senior Fellow at the Institute of Astronomy at the University of Cambridge and Don Pollacco, Professor of Astronomy at the University of Warwick., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss Thomas Malory\'s "Le Morte Darthur", the epic tale of King Arthur and his knights of the Round Table, which was written in the 15th century. The Arthurian legend is one of the most enduring and popular in western literature and the book\'s themes - chivalry, betrayal, love and honour - remain compelling. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Helen Cooper, Professor of Medieval and Renaissance English at the University of Cambridge; Helen Fulton, Professor of Medieval Literature at the University of York and Laura Ashe, CUF Lecturer and Tutorial Fellow at Worcester College at the University of Oxford., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the cult of Mithras, a mystery religion that existed in the Roman Empire from the 1st to the 4th centuries AD. Its rituals included communal meals and a complex seven-stage initiation system. Typical depictions of Mithras show him being born from a rock, enjoying food with the sun god Sol and stabbing a bull. In recent decades, many aspects of the cult have provoked debate, especially as there are no written accounts by its members. What were its origins and why did it eventually die out? Melvyn Bragg is joined by Greg Woolf, Professor of Ancient History at the University of St Andrews; Almut Hintze, Zartoshty Professor of Zoroastrianism at SOAS, University of London and John North, Acting Director of the Institute of Classical Studies, University of London., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the South Sea Bubble, the speculation mania in early 18th-century England which ended in the financial ruin of many investors. People from all walks of life bought shares in the South Sea Company, so when the shares crashed, there was a public outcry and many people faced financial ruin. But how did such a financial crisis develop and how serious were the effects of this early example of a stock market boom and bust? Melvyn Bragg is joined by Anne Murphy, Senior Lecturer in History at the University of Hertfordshire; Helen Paul, Lecturer in Economics and Economic History at the University of Southampton and Roey Sweet, Head of the School of History at the University of Leicester., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the epic poem the Shahnameh of Ferdowsi, the \'Book of Kings\', which has been at the heart of Persian culture for the past 1000 years. It recounts a legendary history of Iran from the dawn of time to the fall of the Persian Empire in the 7th century, depicting battles, romances, family rifts and the struggle between good and evil. The poem has been referred to as the identity card of the Persian people. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Narguess Farzad, Senior Fellow in Persian at SOAS, University of London; Charles Melville, Professor of Persian History at Pembroke College, University of Cambridge and Vesta Sarkhosh Curtis, Curator of Middle Eastern Coins at the British Museum., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the influential British philosopher Bertrand Russell. Born in 1872, Russell is widely regarded as one of the founders of Analytic philosophy, today the dominant philosophical tradition in the English-speaking world. His theory of descriptions had profound consequences for the discipline. Russell also played an active role in many social and political campaigns. He supported women\'s suffrage, was imprisoned for his pacifism during World War I and was a founder of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Melvyn Bragg is joined by AC Grayling, Master of the New College of the Humanities and a Supernumerary Fellow of St Anne\'s College, Oxford; Mike Beaney, Professor of Philosophy at the University of York and Hilary Greaves, Lecturer in Philosophy and Fellow of Somerville College, Oxford., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the history of crystallography, the study of crystals and their structure. The discovery in the early 20th century that X-rays could be diffracted by a crystal revolutionised our knowledge of materials. This crystal technology has touched most people\'s lives, thanks to the vital role it plays in diverse scientific disciplines - from physics and chemistry, to molecular biology and mineralogy. To date, 28 Nobel Prizes have been awarded to scientists working with X-ray crystallography, an indication of its crucial importance. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Judith Howard, Professor of Chemistry at the University of Durham; Chris Hammond, Life Fellow in Material Science at the University of Leeds; and Mike Glazer, Emeritus Professor of Physics at the University of Oxford and Visiting Professor of Physics at the University of Warwick., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the Borgias, the most notorious family in Renaissance Italy. Famed for their treachery and corruption, the Borgias produced two popes during their time of dominance in Rome in the late 15th century. Murder, intrigue and power politics characterised their rule, but many of the stories now told about their depraved behaviour emerged after their demise. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Evelyn Welch, Professor of Renaissance Studies at Queen Mary, University of London; Catherine Fletcher, Lecturer in Public History at the University of Sheffield and Christine Shaw, Honorary Research Fellow at Swansea University., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the French philosopher and social activist Simone Weil. Born in Paris in 1909, her philosophy was both complex and intense. She argued that the presence of suffering in the world was evidence of God\'s love and that love which expects reward was not love at all. Albert Camus believed she was "the only great spirit of our time." Weil died of TB at the age of only 34. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Beatrice Han-Pile, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Essex; Stephen Plant, Dean of Trinity Hall at the University of Cambridge and David Levy, Teaching Fellow in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the Upanishads, the ancient sacred texts of Hinduism. Dating from about 700 BC, the Upanishads ask profound questions about human existence and man\'s place in the cosmos. More than 100 Upanishads were produced, 13 of which are regarded as the canonical scriptures of Hinduism. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Jessica Frazier, Lecturer in Religious Studies at the University of Kent and a Research Fellow at the Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies, University of Oxford; Chakravarthi Ram-Prasad, Professor of Comparative Religion and Philosophy at Lancaster University and Simon Brodbeck, Lecturer in Religious Studies at Cardiff University., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss The Anarchy, the civil war that took place in mid-12th century England. It was a succession dispute between the Empress Matilda, daughter of Henry I, and her cousin, Stephen of Blois. The Anarchy dragged on for nearly 20 years and is so called because of the chaos and lawlessness that characterised the period. But does it deserve the label of \'The Anarchy\'? Why did Matilda fail to become the monarch? What impact did the conflict have on England? Melvyn Bragg is joined by John Gillingham, Emeritus Professor of History at the LSE; Louise Wilkinson, Reader in Medieval History at Canterbury Christ Church University and David Carpenter, Professor of Medieval History at Kings College London., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss Fermat\'s Last Theorem. In 1637 the French mathematician Pierre de Fermat scribbled a note in the margin of one of his books. He claimed to have proved a remarkable property of numbers, but gave no clue as to how he\'d gone about it. Fermat\'s theorem became one of the most iconic problems in mathematics and for centuries mathematicians struggled in vain to work out what his proof had been. It was not until 1995 that the puzzle was finally solved by the British mathematician Andrew Wiles. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Marcus du Sautoy,\rProfessor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford; Vicky Neale,\rFellow and Director of Studies in Mathematics at Murray Edwards College at the University of Cambridge and Samir Siksek, Professor at the Mathematics Institute at the University of Warwick., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the life and influence of William Caxton, the merchant who brought the printing press to Britain. After working abroad for several years, Caxton set up his first printing press in Westminster in 1476. The advent of print is now seen as one of the great revolutions in intellectual history, although it was a revolution that took time to have an effect. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Richard Gameson, Professor of the History of the Book at the University of Durham; Julia Boffey, Professor of Medieval Studies at Queen Mary, University of London and David Rundle of the History Faculty at the University of Oxford., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the life and achievements of Hannibal, one of the most celebrated military leaders in history. Commander of the Carthaginian army, he led his men with elephants across the Alps in order to attack the Roman Republic. His career ended in defeat and exile, but centuries later his tactical genius was admired by generals including Napoleon and Wellington. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Ellen O\'Gorman, Senior Lecturer in Classics at the University of Bristol; Mark Woolmer, Senior Tutor in the Department of Classics and Ancient History at the University of Durham and Louis Rawlings, Senior Lecturer in Ancient History at Cardiff University., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the medieval scholar Gerald of Wales. Born in the 12th century, with both Anglo-Norman and Welsh parentage, Gerald was a cleric and courtier of Henry II. His accounts of journeys he made around Wales and Ireland are among the most colourful and informative chronicles of the Middle Ages. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Henrietta Leyser, Emeritus Fellow of St Peter\'s College, University of Oxford; Michelle Brown, Professor Emerita of Medieval Manuscript Studies at the School of Advanced Study, University of London and Huw Pryce,\rProfessor of Welsh History at Bangor University., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the Ontological Argument. In the 11th century Anselm of Canterbury proposed that it was possible to prove the existence of God using reason alone. His argument was taken further by later thinkers including Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz but other philosophers have rejected it. It remains one of the most discussed problems in philosophy. Melvyn Bragg is joined by John Haldane,\rProfessor of Philosophy at the University of St Andrews; Peter Millican, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Oxford and Clare Carlisle, Lecturer in Philosophy of Religion at King\'s College London., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the Druids, the priests of ancient Europe. Active in Ireland, Britain and Gaul, the Druids were first written about by Roman authors including Julius Caesar and Pliny. They were suspected of leading resistance to the Romans, a fact which led to their eradication from ancient Britain. In the early modern era, however, interest in the Druids revived, and later writers reinvented their activities. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Barry Cunliffe, Emeritus Professor of Archaeology at the University of Oxford; Miranda Aldhouse-Green,\rProfessor of Archaeology at Cardiff University and Justin Champion,\rProfessor of the History of Early Modern Ideas at Royal Holloway, University of London., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the cell, the fundamental building block of life. First observed by Robert Hooke in 1665, cells occur in nature in a bewildering variety of forms. A single human body contains up to a hundred trillion of them. How did the first cell appear, and how did that prototype evolve into the sophisticated cells of the human body? Melvyn Bragg is joined by Steve Jones,\rProfessor of Genetics at UCL; Nick Lane, Senior Lecturer in the Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, UCL and Cathie Martin,\rProfessor in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of East Anglia., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss Hadrian\'s Wall, the largest Roman structure and one of the most important archaeological monuments in Britain. It was built across North England in about 122 AD by the Emperor Hadrian and, even after more than a century of excavations, many mysteries still surround it. Did it have a meaningful defensive role or was it mainly a powerful emperor\'s vanity project? Melvyn Bragg is joined by Greg Woolf, Professor of Ancient History at the University of St Andrews; David Breeze, Former Chief Inspector of Ancient Monuments for Scotland and Visiting Professor of Archaeology at the University of Durham and Lindsay Allason-Jones, Former Reader in Roman Material Culture at the University of Newcastle., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss Scepticism, the idea that it may be impossible to know anything with complete certainty. Socrates is reported to have said that the only thing he knew for certain was that he knew nothing. Scepticism was taken up by later philosophers and came to the fore during the Renaissance, especially in the work of Descartes and Montaigne. Its ideas went on to have a powerful influence on the religious and scientific debates of the Enlightenment. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Peter Millican, Professor of Philosophy at Hertford College, Oxford; Melissa Lane, Professor of Politics at Princeton University and\rJill Kraye, Professor of the History of Renaissance Philosophy and Librarian at the Warburg Institute, University of London., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the life and work of the 9th-century Arab philosopher al-Kindi. The author of more than 250 works, he wrote on many different subjects, from optics to mathematics, music and astrology. He was the first significant thinker to argue that philosophy and Islam had much to offer each other. Today al-Kindi is regarded as one of the greatest scholars of the medieval Islamic world. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Hugh Kennedy, Professor of Arabic at SOAS, University of London; James Montgomery, Sir Thomas Adams\'s Professor of Arabic Elect at the University of Cambridge and Amira Bennison, Senior Lecturer in Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies at the University of Cambridge., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the life of the prominent 19th-century social reformer Annie Besant. Born in 1847, Annie Besant espoused a range of causes including secularism, women\'s rights, Socialism, Irish Home Rule, birth control and better conditions for workers. Later in life she moved to India and took a leading role in the Indian self-rule movement, being appointed the first female president of the Indian National Congress in 1917. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Lawrence Goldman, Fellow in Modern History at St Peter\'s College, University of Oxford; David Stack, Reader in History at the University of Reading and Yasmin Khan, Senior Lecturer in Politics and International Relations at Royal Holloway, University of London., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss James Joyce\'s novel Ulysses. First published 90 years ago, Joyce\'s masterpiece charts a single day in the life of the Dubliner Leopold Bloom. Some early readers were outraged by its sexual content and daringly scatalogical humour, and the novel was banned in most English-speaking countries for a decade after it first appeared. Today Ulysses is widely regarded as the greatest example of literary modernism. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Steven Connor, Professor of Modern Literature and Theory at Birkbeck, University of London; Jeri Johnson, Senior Fellow in English at Exeter College, Oxford and Richard Brown, Reader in Modern English Literature at the University of Leeds., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the biblical king Solomon, celebrated for his wisdom and as the architect of the First Temple in Jerusalem. Solomon is an important figure in Judaism, Islam and Christianity alike, and is also credited with the authorship of several scriptural texts. For many centuries Solomon was seen as the archetypal enlightened monarch, and his example influenced notions of kingship from the Middle Ages onwards. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Martin Palmer, Director of the International Consultancy on Religion, Education, and Culture; Philip Alexander,\rEmeritus Professor of Jewish Studies at the University of Manchester and Katharine Dell, Senior Lecturer in Old Testament Studies at the University of Cambridge, and Fellow of St Catherine\'s College, Cambridge., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the Trojan War, one of the best known events of Greek mythology. According to the traditional story, the war began when a Trojan prince, Paris, eloped with the Spartan queen Helen. A Greek army besieged Troy for ten years before the city was finally overrun and destroyed. But does the Trojan War story have any basis in fact? And why has it proved such an enduring legend? Melvyn Bragg is joined by Edith Hall, Professor of Classics at King\'s College London; Ellen Adams, Lecturer in Classical Art and Archaeology at King\'s College London and Susan Sherratt, Lecturer in Archaeology at the University of Sheffield., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the celebrated Venetian explorer Marco Polo. In 1271 Polo set off on an epic journey through Asia and he was away for more than twenty years. When he returned, he told extraordinary tales of his adventures. The Travels of Marco Polo was one of the most popular books produced in the age before printing. For centuries it was seen as the first and best account of life in the mysterious East, but today the accuracy and even truth of Marco Polo\'s work is often disputed. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Frances Wood, Lead Curator of Chinese Collections at the British Library; Joan Pau Rubies, Reader in International History at the London School of Economics and Political Science and Debra Higgs Strickland, Senior Lecturer in the History of Art at the University of Glasgow., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss On War, a treatise on the theory and practice of warfare written by the Prussian soldier and intellectual Carl von Clausewitz. First published in 1832, Clausewitz\'s magnum opus is commonly regarded as the most important book about military theory ever written. Its influence is felt today not just on the battlefield but also in politics and business. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Saul David, Professor of War Studies at the University of Buckingham; Hew Strachan,\rChichele Professor of the History of War at the University of Oxford and Beatrice Heuser, Professor of International Relations at the University of Reading., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss game theory, the mathematical study of decision-making. Some of the games studied in game theory have become well known outside academia - they include the Prisoner\'s Dilemma, an intriguing scenario popularised in novels and films. Today game theory is seen as an important tool in evolutionary biology, economics, computing and philosophy. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Ian Stewart, Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Warwick; Andrew Colman, Professor of Psychology at the University of Leicester and Richard Bradley, Professor of Philosophy at the London School of Economics and Political Science., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss Voltaire\'s novel Candide. First published in 1759, the novel follows the adventures of a young man, Candide, and his mentor, the philosopher Pangloss. Often uproariously funny, the novel is a biting satire whose targets include bad literature, extremist religion and the vanity of kings and politicians. It captivated contemporary readers and has proved one of French literature\'s most enduring classics. Melvyn Bragg is joined by David Wootton, Professor of History at the University of York; Nicholas Cronk, Professor of French Literature and Director of the Voltaire Foundation at the University of Oxford and Caroline Warman, Lecturer in French and Fellow of Jesus College at the University of Oxford., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the Battle of Bosworth Field, the celebrated encounter between Lancastrian and Yorkist forces in August 1485, which resulted in the death of Richard III. Henry Tudor\'s victory established the Tudor dynasty which was to rule for over a century. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Anne Curry,\rProfessor of Medieval History and Dean of Humanities at the University of Southampton; Steven Gunn, Tutor and Fellow in Modern History at Merton College, Oxford and David Grummitt, Lecturer in British History at the University of Kent., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss Neoplatonism, the school of thought founded in the 3rd century AD by the philosopher Plotinus. The Neoplatonists brought a new religious sensibility to bear on Plato\'s thought, outlining a complex cosmology which linked the human with the divine, headed by a mysterious power called the One. Neoplatonism shaped early Christian, Jewish and Muslim religious scholarship, and remained a dominant force in European thought until the Renaissance. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Angie Hobbs, Associate Professor of Philosophy and Senior Fellow in the Public Understanding of Philosophy at the University of Warwick; Peter Adamson, Professor of Ancient and Medieval Philosophy at King\'s College London and Anne Sheppard, Professor of Ancient Philosophy at Royal Holloway, University of London., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the emergence of geology - the study of the Earth, its history and composition. Although geology only emerged as a separate area of study in the late 18th century, many earlier thinkers had studied rocks, fossils and the materials from which the Earth is made. But how did such haphazard study of rocks and fossils develop into a rigorous scientific discipline? Melvyn Bragg is joined by Stephen Pumfrey,\rSenior Lecturer in the History of Science at Lancaster University; Andrew Scott, Professor of Applied Palaeobotany at Royal Holloway, University of London and Leucha Veneer,\rResearch Associate at the Centre for the History of Science, Technology and Medicine at the University of Manchester., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the origins of Quakerism. In the mid-17th century an itinerant preacher, George Fox, became the central figure of the Religious Society of Friends. Persecuted for many years, particularly after the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, the Quakers survived to become an influential religious group, known for their pacifism and philanthropy. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Justin Champion,\rProfessor of the History of Early Modern Ideas at Royal Holloway, University of London; John Coffey,\rProfessor of Early Modern History at the University of Leicester and Kate Peters, Fellow in History at Murray Edwards College at the University of Cambridge., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the measurement of time. Early civilisations used the movements of heavenly bodies to tell the time, then mechanical clocks emerged in Europe in the medieval period. For hundreds of years clocks were inaccurate but now atomic clocks are capable of keeping time to a second in 15 million years. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Kristen Lippincott, Former Director of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich; Jim Bennett, Director of the Museum of the History of Science at the University of Oxford and Jonathan Betts, Senior Curator of Horology at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the work and influence of the 18th-century philosopher Moses Mendelssohn. Moses\'s learning earned him the sobriquet of the \'German Socrates\' and he is considered to be one of the principal architects of the Haskala, the Jewish Enlightenment. Today, he is perhaps best remembered for his efforts to bring Jewish and German culture closer together and for his plea for religious toleration. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Christopher Clark, Professor of Modern European History at the University of Cambridge; Abigail Green, Tutor and Fellow in History at the University of Oxford and Adam Sutcliffe, Senior Lecturer in European History at King\'s College, London., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss Vitruvius\' De Architectura. Written 2000 years ago, Vitruvius\' treatise is a ten-volume work on Roman engineering and architecture, the only surviving text on the subject from the ancient world. The rediscovery of this work in the 15th century provided the impetus for the neoclassical architectural movement, and Vitruvius exerted a significant influence on the work of Renaissance architects including Palladio, Brunelleschi and Alberti. It remains a hugely important text today. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Serafina Cuomo, Reader in Roman History at Birkbeck, University of London; Robert Tavernor, Emeritus Professor of Architecture and Urban Design at the London School of Economics and Alice Koenig, Lecturer in Latin and Classical Studies at the University of St Andrews., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss Lyrical Ballads, the collection of poems by William Wordsworth and Samuel Coleridge first published in 1798, which attempted to cast off the stultifying conventions of formal 18th-century poetry. Lyrical Ballads contains some of the best-known work by Coleridge and Wordsworth, including The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Tintern Abbey - and is today seen as a point of radical departure for poetry in English. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Judith Hawley, Professor of Eighteenth-Century Literature at Royal Holloway, University of London; Jonathan Bate,\rProvost of Worcester College, Oxford and\rPeter Swaab, Reader in English Literature at University College London., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the life and work of Benjamin Franklin. A printer, statesman, diplomat, writer and scientist, Franklin was one of the most remarkable individuals of the 18th century. As the only Founding Father to have signed all three of the fundamental documents of the United States of America, including its Declaration of Independence and Constitution, Benjamin Franklin occupies a unique position in the history of the nation. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Simon Middleton, Senior Lecturer in American History at the University of Sheffield; Simon Newman,\rSir Denis Brogan Professor of American History at the University of Glasgow and Patricia Fara, Senior Tutor at Clare College, University of Cambridge., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the physics of electrical conduction. In investigating electrical conduction scientists discovered two new classes of material. Semiconductors have given us the transistor, the solar cell and the silicon chip, and have revolutionised telecommunications. And superconductors, remarkable materials first observed in 1911, are used in medical imaging and at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Frank Close, Professor of Physics at the University of Oxford; Jenny Nelson, Professor of Physics at Imperial College London and Lesley Cohen\rProfessor of Solid State Physics at Imperial College London., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the An Lushan Rebellion, a major uprising against the Chinese Tang Dynasty in 755 AD. Although the dynasty\'s authority was restored, it never regained the prosperity of previous generations. The An Lushan Rebellion displaced millions of people and changed the relationship between the Chinese state and neighbouring powers, but it also left a rich cultural legacy in the poetry memorialising this seismic event. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Frances Wood, Lead Curator of Chinese at the British Library; Naomi Standen, Professor of Medieval History at the University of Birmingham and Hilde de Weerdt, Fellow and Lecturer in Chinese History at Pembroke College, Oxford., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the life and work of the 16th century humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus, almost universally recognised as the greatest classical scholar of his age. An important religious writer, he was also an outspoken critic of the Church, but when the Reformation began Erasmus chose to remain a member of the Catholic Church rather than side with Martin Luther and the reformers. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Diarmaid MacCulloch,\rProfessor of the History of the Church at the University of Oxford; Eamon Duffy, Professor of the History of Christianity at the University of Cambridge and Jill Kraye, Professor of the History of Renaissance Philosophy and Librarian at the Warburg Institute, University of London., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the Kama Sutra, one of the most celebrated and misunderstood texts of Indian literature. Although it is best known today for its chapter devoted to sexual pleasure, this Sanskrit work is a wide ranging manual to a life of fulfilment, which has had a profound influence on Indian culture and thought. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Julius Lipner, Professor of Hinduism and the Comparative Study of Religion at the University of Cambridge; Jessica Frazier, Lecturer in Religious Studies at the University of Kent and Research Fellow at the Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies and David Smith, Reader in South Asian Religions at the University of Lancaster., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the evolution of the Scientific Method, the systematic and analytical approach to scientific thought. It became a topic of intense debate in the 17th century, and thinkers including Isaac Newton, Thomas Huxley and Karl Popper all made important contributions. Some of the greatest discoveries of the modern age were informed by their work, although even today the term \'scientific method\' remains difficult to define. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Simon Schaffer, Professor of the History of Science at the University of Cambridge; John Worrall, Professor of the Philosophy of Science at the LSE and Michela Massimi,\rSenior Lecturer in the Philosophy of Science at University College London., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss 1848, the year that saw Europe engulfed in revolution. Across the continent, from Paris to Palermo, liberals rose against conservative governments. The first stirrings of rebellion came in January, in Sicily; in February the French monarchy fell; and within a few months Germany, Austria, Hungary and Italy had all been overtaken by revolutionary fervour. Only a few countries were spared.  With Tim Blanning, Emeritus Professor of History at the University of Cambridge; Lucy Riall, Professor of History at Birkbeck, University of London; and Mike Rapport, Senior Lecturer in History at the University of Stirling., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the Safavid Dynasty, rulers of the Persian empire between the 16th and 18th centuries. At the peak of their success the Safavids ruled over a vast territory which included all of modern-day Iran. They converted their subjects to Shi\'a Islam, creating the religious identity of today\'s Iran, and their capital Isfahan became one of the most magnificent cities in the world. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Robert Gleave, Professor of Arabic Studies at the University of Exeter; Emma Loosley,\rSenior Lecturer at the School of Arts, Histories and Cultures at the University of Manchester and Andrew Newman, Reader in Islamic Studies and Persian at the University of Edinburgh., Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the giant molecules that form the basis of all life. Macromolecules, also known as polymers, are long chains of atoms which form the proteins that make up our bodies, as well as many of the materials of modern life. We\'ve only known about macromolecules for just over a century, so what is the story behind them and how might they change our lives in the future? Melvyn Bragg is joined by Athene Donald, Professor of Experimental Physics at the University of Cambridge; Charlotte Williams, Reader in Polymer Chemistry and Catalysis at Imperial College London and Tony Ryan, Pro-Vice Chancellor for the Faculty of Science at the University of Sheffield., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss Daniel Defoe\'s novel Robinson Crusoe. Published in 1719, it was an immediate success and is considered the classic adventure story - the sailor stranded on a desert island who learns to tame the environment and the native population. Robinson Crusoe has been interpreted in myriad ways, from colonial fable to religious instruction manual to capitalist tract, yet it is perhaps best known today as a children\'s story. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Karen O\'Brien, Pro-Vice Chancellor for Education at the University of Birmingham; Judith Hawley, Professor of Eighteenth-Century Literature at Royal Holloway, University of London and Bob Owens, Emeritus Professor of English Literature at the Open University., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the Concordat of Worms. This treaty between the papacy and the Holy Roman Empire, signed in 1122, put an end, at least for a time, to years of power struggle and bloodshed. It created a historic distinction between secular power and spiritual authority, defining more clearly the respective powers of monarchs and the Church. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Henrietta Leyser, Emeritus Fellow of St Peter\'s College, University of Oxford; Kate Cushing, Reader in Medieval History at Keele University and John Gillingham, Emeritus Professor of History at the London School of Economics and Political Science, Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus. Writing in the 5th century BC, Heraclitus believed that everything is constantly changing. He expressed this thought in a famous epigram: "No man ever steps into the same river twice." At times a rationalist, at others a mystic, Heraclitus is an intriguing figure who influenced major later philosophers and movements such as Plato and the Stoics. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Angie Hobbs, Associate Professor of Philosophy and Senior Fellow in the Public Understanding of Philosophy at the University of Warwick; Peter Adamson, Professor of Ancient and Medieval Philosophy at King\'s College London and James Warren, Senior Lecturer in Classics and a Fellow of Corpus Christi College, University of Cambridge., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the life and work of the Victorian poet Christina Rossetti. Rossetti was born into an artistic family and her siblings included Dante Gabriel, one of the leading lights of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Her poetry has a spirituality and sensitivity that has led to her redisovery in recent decades, not least by feminist critics who praise her powerful and independent poetic voice. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Dinah Birch, Professor of English Literature at Liverpool University; Rhian Williams, Lecturer in Nineteenth-Century English Literature at the University of Glasgow and Nicholas Shrimpton, Emeritus Fellow of Lady Margaret Hall, University of Oxford., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the revolutionary Jewish leader Judas Maccabeus. Born in the 2nd century BC, Judas led his followers in a rebellion against the Seleucid Empire, which was attempting to impose Greek culture and religion on the Jews. He succeeded in winning religious freedom, but it was not until 20 years after Judas\'s death that Judaea finally became an independent state. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Helen Bond, Senior Lecturer in the New Testament at Edinburgh University; Tessa Rajak, Emeritus Professor of Ancient History at the University of Reading and Philip Alexander, Emeritus Professor of Jewish Studies at the University of Manchester., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the ancient Greek astronomer and mathematician Ptolemy, and consider how and why his geocentric theory of the universe held sway for more than a thousand years. It was not until 1543, and Copernicus\'s heliocentric theory of the world, that the Ptolemaic model was finally challenged. But how and why did Ptolemy\'s system survive for so long? Melvyn Bragg is joined by Liba Taub of Cambridge University, Jim Bennett of the Museum of the History of Science at the University of Oxford, and Charles Burnett of the University of London., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the Continental-Analytic split in Western philosophy. The Analytic school favours a logical, scientific approach, in contrast to the Continental emphasis on the importance of time and place. But what are the origins of this split and is it possible that contemporary philosophers can bridge the gap between the two? Melvyn Bragg is joined by Stephen Mulhall of New College, University of Oxford, Beatrice Han-Pile\rof the University of Essex and Hans Johann-Glock of the University of Zurich., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the origins, science and mythology of the Moon. Humans have been fascinated by our only known satellite since prehistory but it was Galileo Galilei who first studied the Moon in detail with a telescope in 1609. Mankind first walked on the Moon in 1969 and since then advances in space science have given us some startling insights into the history of the Moon and our own planet. However, many intriguing questions remain unanswered. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Paul Murdin of Liverpool John Moores University, Carolin Crawford of the University of Cambridge and Ian Crawford of Birkbeck, University of London., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the Siege of Tenochtitlan. In 1521 the Spanish conquistador Hernan Cortes led an army of Spanish and native forces against Tenochtitlan, the spectacular island capital of the Aztec civilisation. After a prolonged siege and fierce battle, the city finally fell. This major confrontation between Old and New Worlds precipitated the downfall of the Aztec Empire and marked a new phase in European colonisation of the Americas. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Alan Knight of the University of Oxford, Elizabeth Graham of University College London and Caroline Dodds Pennock of the University of Sheffield., Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss Delacroix\'s painting July 28: Liberty Leading the People. In 1830 revolution once more overtook France, when a popular uprising toppled the French Bourbon monarch, Charles X. Delacroix\'s allegorical work, personifying Liberty as a female figure, has become an iconic symbol of human freedom, and one of the most influential works of art of the nineteenth century. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Tim Blanning of the University of Cambridge, Tamar Garb of University College London and Simon Lee of the University of Reading., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the Ming Voyages. In 1405 a Chinese admiral, Zheng He, set sail with an enormous fleet of ships carrying more than 27,000 people. This was the first of seven voyages which took Zheng and his ships all over the known world, from India to the Gulf of Persia and as far as East Africa. They took Chinese goods, evidence of the might of the Ming Empire, to the people they visited; and they also returned to China with treasure from the places they visited, and exotic items including a live giraffe.\r\rThese extraordinary journeys live on in the imagination and the historical record - and had a profound effect on China\'s relationship with the rest of the world.\r\rWith: Rana Mitter, Professor of the History and Politics of Modern China at the University of Oxford; Julia Lovell,\rLecturer in Chinese History at Birkbeck College, University of London; Craig Clunas, Professor of the History of Art at the University of Oxford.\rProducer: Thomas Morris., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the work of the philosopher David Hume. A key figure in the Scottish Enlightenment of the eighteenth century, Hume was an empiricist who believed that humans can only have knowledge of things they have themselves experienced. He gave a sceptical account of religion, which caused many to suspect him of atheism. He was also the author of a bestselling History of England. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Peter Millican of the University of Oxford, Helen Beebee of the University of Birmingham and James Harris of the University of St Andrews., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the Etruscan civilisation which flourished in Italy for much of the first millennium BC. Developing a sophisticated culture, they were skilled soldiers, architects and artists. Eventually the Etruscan civilisation was absorbed into that of Rome, but not before it had profoundly influenced Roman art, religion and politics. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Phil Perkins of the Open University, David Ridgway of the University of London and Corinna Riva of University College London., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the Japanese belief system of Shinto, a religion without gods, scriptures or a founder. Shinto shrines are some of the most prominent features of the Japanese landscape, where over 100 million people - most of the population - count themselves as adherents. Although it has changed considerably in the face of political upheaval and international conflict, it remains one of the most significant influences on Japanese culture. Melvyn Bragg is joined by Martin Palmer, Director of the International Consultancy on Religion, Education and Culture; Richard Bowring, \rProfessor of Japanese Studies at the University of Cambridge; and Lucia Dolce\rSenior Lecturer in Japanese Religion and Japanese at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London., Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the Hippocratic Oath.\rThe Greek physician Hippocrates, active in the fifth century BC, has been described as the father of medicine, although little is known about his life and some scholars even argue that he was not one person but several. A large body of work originally attributed to him was disseminated widely in the ancient world, and contains treatises on a wide variety of subjects, from fractures to medical ethics.\r\rThe best known is the Hippocratic Oath, an ethical code for doctors.  Although it has often been revised and adapted, the Hippocratic Oath remains one of the most significant and best known documents of medical science.\r\rWith:\rVivian Nutton, Emeritus Professor of the History of Medicine at University College London\r\rHelen King, Professor of Classical Studies at the Open University\r\rPeter Pormann, Wellcome Trust Associate Professor in Classics and Ancient History at the University of Warwick]'

aS'TED is a nonprofit devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. On this feed, you\'ll find TEDTalks video to inspire, intrigue and stir the imagination from some of the world\'s leading thinkers and doers, speaking from the stage at TED conferences, TEDx events and partner events around the world. This podcast is also available in high-def video and audio-only formats., Before he hit eighteen, Fred Swaniker had lived in Ghana, Gambia, Botswana and Zimbabwe. What he learned from a childhood across Africa was that while good leaders can\'t make much of a difference in societies with strong institutions, in countries with weak structures, leaders could make or break a country. In a passionate talk the entrepreneur and TED Fellow looks at different generations of African leaders and imagines how to develop the leadership of the future., In 2011 Ronnie Cahana suffered a severe stroke that left him with locked-in syndrome: completely paralyzed except for his eyes. While this might shatter a normal person\xe2\x80\x99s mental state, Cahana found peace in \xe2\x80\x9cdimming down the external chatter,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cfell in love with life and body anew.\xe2\x80\x9d In a somber, emotional talk, his daughter Kitra shares how she documented her father\'s spiritual experience, as he helped guide others even in a state of seeming helplessness., 50 million people in the world today have been forcefully displaced from their home \xe2\x80\x94 a level not seen since WWII. Right now, more than 3 million Syrian refugees are seeking shelter in neighboring countries. In Lebanon, half of these refugees are children; only 20% are in school. Melissa Fleming of the UN\'s refugee agency calls on all of us to make sure that refugee camps are healing places where people can develop the skills they\xe2\x80\x99ll need to rebuild their hometowns., In 2013, international migrants sent $413 billion home to families and friends \xe2\x80\x94 three times more than the total of global foreign aid (about $135 billion). This money, known as remittances, makes a significant difference in the lives of those receiving it and plays a major role in the economies of many countries. Economist Dilip Ratha describes the promise of these \xe2\x80\x9cdollars wrapped with love\xe2\x80\x9d and analyzes how they are stifled by practical and regulatory obstacles., Pia Mancini and her colleagues want to upgrade democracy in Argentina and beyond. Through their open-source mobile platform they want to bring citizens inside the legislative process, and run candidates who will listen to what they say., About 10,000 people a month Google the phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cAm I ugly?\xe2\x80\x9d Meaghan Ramsey of the Dove Self-Esteem Project has a feeling that many of them are young girls. In a deeply unsettling talk, she walks us through the surprising impacts of low body and image confidence\xe2\x80\x94from lower grade point averages to greater risk-taking with drugs and alcohol. And then shares the key things all of us can do to disrupt this reality. , You\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything right at work, taking all the right advice, but you\xe2\x80\x99re just not moving up. Why? Susan Colantuono shares a simple, surprising piece of advice you might not have heard before quite so plainly. This talk, while aimed at an audience of women, has universal takeaways -- for men and women, new grads and midcareer workers., Warning: This talk might contain much more than you\xe2\x80\x99d ever want to know about the way the world poops. But as sanitation activist (and TED Fellow) Francis de los Reyes asks \xe2\x80\x94 doesn\xe2\x80\x99t everyone deserve a safe place to go? , Just like his beloved grandfather, Avi Reichental is a maker of things. The difference is, now he can use 3D printers to make almost anything, out of almost any material. Reichental tours us through the possibilities of 3D printing, for everything from printed candy to highly custom sneakers., Big Data is everywhere \xe2\x80\x94 even the skies. In an informative talk, astronomer Andrew Connolly shows how large amounts of data are being collected about our universe, recording it in its ever-changing moods. Just how do scientists capture so many images at scale? It starts with a giant telescope \xe2\x80\xa6, Rishi Manchanda has worked as a doctor in South Central Los Angeles for a decade, where he\xe2\x80\x99s come to realize: His job isn\xe2\x80\x99t just about treating a patient\xe2\x80\x99s symptoms, but about getting to the root cause of what is making them ill\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9cupstream" factors like a poor diet, a stressful job, a lack of fresh air. It\xe2\x80\x99s a powerful call for doctors to pay attention to a patient\'s life outside the exam room., Artist Uldus Bakhtiozina uses photographs to poke fun at societal norms in her native Russia. A glimpse into Russian youth culture and a short, fun reminder not to take ourselves too seriously., How much do you know about the world? Hans Rosling, with his famous charts of global population, health and income data (and an extra-extra-long pointer), demonstrates that you have a high statistical chance of being quite wrong about what you think you know. Play along with his audience quiz \xe2\x80\x94 then, from Hans\xe2\x80\x99 son Ola, learn 4 ways to quickly get less ignorant., If you\xe2\x80\x99re raised on dogma and hate, can you choose a different path? Zak Ebrahim was just seven years old when his father helped plan the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. His story is shocking, powerful and, ultimately, inspiring., Author Isabel Allende is 71. Yes, she has a few wrinkles\xe2\x80\x94but she has incredible perspective too. In this candid talk, meant for viewers of all ages, she talks about her fears as she gets older and shares how she plans to keep on living passionately., Why is there something instead of nothing? In other words: Why does the universe exist (and why are we in it)? Philosopher and writer Jim Holt follows this question toward three possible answers. Or four. Or none., Which of the following is awesome: your lunch or the Great Pyramid of Giza? Comedian Jill Shargaa sounds a hilarious call for us to save the word "awesome" for things that truly inspire awe., A post-apocalyptic Earth, emptied of humans, seems like the stuff of science fiction TV and movies. But in this short, surprising talk, Lord Martin Rees asks us to think about our real existential risks \xe2\x80\x94 natural and human-made threats that could wipe out humanity. As a concerned member of the human race, he asks: What\xe2\x80\x99s the worst thing that could possibly happen?, Ziyah Gafic\xcc\x81 photographs everyday objects\xe2\x80\x94watches, shoes, glasses. But these images are deceptively simple; the items in them have been exhumed from the mass graves of the Bosnian War. Gafic\xcc\x81, a TED Fellow and Sarajevo native, is photographing every item from these graves in order to create a living archive of the identities of those lost.\xc2\xa0, Behind those funny animal videos, sometimes, are oddly human-like problems. Laurel Braitman studies non-human animals who exhibit signs of mental health issues -- from compulsive bears to self-destructive rats to monkeys with unlikely friends. Braitman asks what we as humans can learn from watching animals cope with depression, sadness and other all-too-human problems., Children\xe2\x80\x99s book author Jarrett Krosoczka shares the origins of the Lunch Lady graphic novel series, in which undercover school heroes serve lunch\xe2\x80\xa6and justice! His new project, School Lunch Hero Day, reveals how cafeteria lunch staff provide more than food, and illustrates how powerful a thank you can be., Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web 25 years ago. So it\xe2\x80\x99s worth a listen when he warns us: There\xe2\x80\x99s a battle ahead. Eroding net neutrality, filter bubbles and centralizing corporate control all threaten the web\xe2\x80\x99s wide-open spaces. It\xe2\x80\x99s up to users to fight for the right to access and openness. The question is, What kind of Internet do we want?, "We spend so much time listening to the things people are saying that we rarely pay attention to the things they don\'t," says poet and teacher Clint Smith. A short, powerful piece from the heart, about finding the courage to speak up against ignorance and injustice., Far too many Americans are illiterate in power \xe2\x80\x94 what it is, how it operates and why some people have it. As a result, those few who do understand power wield disproportionate influence over everyone else. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to make civics sexy again,\xe2\x80\x9d says civics educator Eric Liu. \xe2\x80\x9cAs sexy as it was during the American Revolution or the Civil Rights Movement.\xe2\x80\x9d, In the United States, the agencies that govern prisons are often called \xe2\x80\x98Department of Corrections.\xe2\x80\x99 And yet, their focus is on containing and controlling inmates. Dan Pacholke, Deputy Secretary for the Washington State Department of Corrections, shares a different vision: of prisons that provide humane living conditions as well as opportunities for meaningful work and learning. , Nick Hanauer is a rich guy, an unrepentant capitalist \xe2\x80\x94 and he has something to say to his fellow plutocrats: Wake up! Growing inequality is about to push our societies into conditions resembling pre-revolutionary France. Hear his argument about why a dramatic increase in minimum wage could grow the middle class, deliver economic prosperity ... and prevent a revolution., The new breed of high-tech self-monitors (measuring heartrate, sleep, steps per day) might seem targeted at competitive athletes. But Talithia Williams, a statistician, makes a compelling case that all of us should be measuring and recording simple data about our bodies every day \xe2\x80\x94 because our own data can reveal much more than even our doctors may know., Megan Washington is one of Australia\'s premier singer/songwriters. And, since childhood, she has had a stutter. In this bold and personal talk, she reveals how she copes with this speech impediment\xe2\x80\x94from avoiding the letter combination \xe2\x80\x9cst\xe2\x80\x9d to tricking her brain by changing her words at the last minute to, yes, singing the things she has to say rather than speaking them., Tour the deep dark world of the East German state security agency known as Stasi. Uniquely powerful at spying on its citizens, until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 the Stasi masterminded a system of surveillance and psychological pressure that kept the country under control for decades. Hubertus Knabe studies the Stasi \xe2\x80\x94 and was spied on by them. He shares stunning details from the fall of a surveillance state, and shows how easy it was for neighbor to turn on neighbor., Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clike\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cshare\xe2\x80\x9d buttons are seen 22 billion times a day, making them some of the most-viewed design elements ever created. Margaret Gould Stewart, Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s director of product design, outlines three rules for design at such a massive scale\xe2\x80\x94one so big that the tiniest of tweaks can cause global outrage, but also so large that the subtlest of improvements can positively impact the lives of many., At the online University of the People, anyone with a high school diploma can take classes toward a degree in business administration or computer science \xe2\x80\x94 without standard tuition fees (though exams cost money). Founder Shai Reshef hopes that higher education is changing "from being a privilege for the few to a basic right, affordable and accessible for all.", When he was young, artist Shih Chieh Huang loved taking toys apart and perusing the aisles of night markets in Taiwan for unexpected objects. Today, this TED Fellow creates madcap sculptures that seem to have a life of their own\xe2\x80\x94with eyes that blink, tentacles that unfurl and parts that light up like bioluminescent sea creatures., Surgeons are required every day to puncture human skin before procedures \xe2\x80\x94 with the risk of damaging what\'s on the other side. In a fascinating talk, find out how mechanical engineer Nikolai Begg is using physics to update an important medical device, called the trocar, and improve one of the most dangerous moments in many common surgeries., Our consciousness is a fundamental aspect of our existence, says philosopher David Chalmers: \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing we know about more directly\xe2\x80\xa6. but at the same time it\xe2\x80\x99s the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.\xe2\x80\x9d He shares some ways to think about the movie playing in our heads., David Kwong is a magician who makes crossword puzzles -- in other words, a pretty nerdy guy. And for his next trick ... , Karima Bennoune shares four powerful stories of real people fighting against fundamentalism in their own communities \xe2\x80\x94 refusing to allow the faith they love to become a tool for crime, attacks and murder. These personal stories humanize one of the most overlooked human-rights struggles in the world., MIT Media Lab founder Nicholas Negroponte takes you on a journey through the last 30 years of tech. The consummate predictor highlights interfaces and innovations he foresaw in the 1970s and 1980s that were scoffed at then but are ubiquitous today. And he leaves you with one last (absurd? brilliant?) prediction for the coming 30 years., \xe2\x80\x9cRemember before the internet?\xe2\x80\x9d asks Joi Ito. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember when people used to try to predict the future?\xe2\x80\x9d In this engaging talk, the head of the MIT Media Lab skips the future predictions and instead shares a new approach to creating in the moment: building quickly and improving constantly, without waiting for permission or for proof that you have the right idea. This kind of bottom-up innovation is seen in the most fascinating, futuristic projects emerging today, and it starts, he says, with being open and alert to what\xe2\x80\x99s going on around you right now. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be a futurist, he suggests: be a now-ist. , We often think of bias and prejudice as rooted in ignorance. But as psychologist Paul Bloom seeks to show, prejudice is often natural, rational ... even moral. The key, says Bloom, is to understand how our own biases work -- so we can take control when they go wrong., It\'s an unexpected side effect of globalization: problems that once would have stayed local\xe2\x80\x94say, a bank lending out too much money\xe2\x80\x94now have consequences worldwide. But still, countries operate independently, as if alone on the planet. Policy advisor Simon Anholt has dreamed up an unusual scale to get governments thinking outwardly: The Good Country Index. In a riveting and funny talk, he answers the question, "Which country does the most good?" The answer may surprise you (especially if you live in the US or China)., Biologist Sara Lewis has spent the past 20 years getting to the bottom of the magic and wonder of fireflies. In this charming talk, she tells us how and why the beetles produce their silent sparks, what happens when two fireflies have sex, and why one group of females is known as the firefly vampire. (It\'s not pretty.) Find out more astonishing facts about fireflies in Lewis\' footnotes, below., Chris Domas is a cybersecurity researcher, operating on what\xe2\x80\x99s become a new front of war, "cyber." In this engaging talk, he shows how researchers use pattern recognition and reverse engineering (and pull a few all-nighters) to understand a chunk of binary code whose purpose and contents they don\'t know., Ge Wang makes computer music, but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t all about coded bleeps and blips. With the Stanford Laptop Orchestra, he creates new instruments out of unexpected materials\xe2\x80\x94like an Ikea bowl\xe2\x80\x94that allow musicians to play music that\xe2\x80\x99s both beautiful and expressive. , Many of the world\'s biggest problems require asking questions of scientists -- but why should we believe what they say? Historian of science Naomi Oreskes thinks deeply about our relationship to belief and draws out three problems with common attitudes toward scientific inquiry -- and gives her own reasoning for why we ought to trust science., Lorrie Faith Cranor studied thousands of real passwords to figure out the surprising, very common mistakes that users -- and secured sites -- make to compromise security. And how, you may ask, did she study thousands of real passwords without compromising the security of any users? That\'s a story in itself. It\'s secret data worth knowing, especially if your password is 123456 ... , In 1991, Shaka Senghor shot and killed a man. He was, he says, "a drug dealer with a quick temper and a semi-automatic pistol." Jailed for second degree murder, that could very well have been the end of the story. But it wasn\'t. Instead, it was the beginning of a years-long journey to redemption, one with humbling and sobering lessons for us all., What must our dogs be thinking when they look at us? Poet Billy Collins imagines the inner lives of two very different companions. It\xe2\x80\x99s a charming short talk, perfect for taking a break and dreaming \xe2\x80\xa6, Jamila Lyiscott is a \xe2\x80\x9ctri-tongued orator;\xe2\x80\x9d in her powerful spoken-word essay \xe2\x80\x9cBroken English,\xe2\x80\x9d she celebrates \xe2\x80\x94 and challenges \xe2\x80\x94 the three distinct flavors of English she speaks with her friends, in the classroom and with her parents. As she explores the complicated history and present-day identity that each language represents, she unpacks what it means to be \xe2\x80\x9carticulate.\xe2\x80\x9d, Here\'s a talk that could literally change your life. Which career should I pursue? Should I break up -- or get married?! Where should I live? Big decisions like these can be agonizingly difficult.  But that\'s because we think about them the wrong way, says philosopher Ruth Chang. She offers a powerful new framework for shaping who we truly are., One could argue that slang words like \xe2\x80\x98hangry,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98defriend\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98adorkable\xe2\x80\x99 fill crucial meaning gaps in the English language, even if they don\'t appear in the dictionary. After all, who actually decides which words make it into those pages? Language historian Anne Curzan gives a charming look at the humans behind dictionaries, and the choices they make., Plenty of good things are done in the name of religion, and plenty of bad things too. But what is religion, exactly \xe2\x80\x94 is it good or bad, in and of itself? Philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah offers a generous, surprising view., You may not know it yet, but AJ Jacobs is probably your cousin (many, many times removed). Using genealogy websites, he\xe2\x80\x99s been following the unexpected links that make us all, however distantly, related. His goal: to throw the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest family reunion. See you there?, While studying for his PhD in physics, Uri Alon thought he was a failure because all his research paths led to dead ends. But, with the help of improv theater, he came to realize that there could be joy in getting lost. A call for scientists to stop thinking of research as a direct line from question to answer, but as something more creative. It\'s a message that will resonate, no matter what your field. , In 2002, investigative journalist and TED Fellow Will Potter took a break from his regular beat, writing about shootings and murders for the Chicago Tribune. He went to help a local group campaigning against animal testing: "I thought it would be a safe way to do something positive," he says. Instead, he was arrested, and so began his ongoing journey into a world in which peaceful protest is branded as terrorism., The beauty of hackers, says cybersecurity expert Keren Elazari, is that they force us to evolve and improve. Yes, some hackers are bad guys, but many are working to fight government corruption and advocate for our rights. By exposing vulnerabilities, they push the Internet to become stronger and healthier, wielding their power to create a better world., As a member of both the African American and LGBT communities, filmmaker Yoruba Richen is fascinated with the overlaps and tensions between the gay rights and the civil rights movements. She explores how the two struggles intertwine and propel each other forward \xe2\x80\x94 and, in an unmissable argument, she dispels a myth about their points of conflict. A powerful reminder that we all have a stake in equality., How can robots learn to stabilize on rough terrain, walk upside down, do gymnastic maneuvers in air and run into walls without harming themselves? Robert Full takes a look at the incredible body of the cockroach to show what it can teach robotics engineers. , "We\'re all going to die -- and poems can help us live with that." In a charming and funny talk, literary critic Stephen Burt takes us on a lyrical journey with some of his favorite poets, all the way down to a line break and back up to the human urge to imagine. , Two hundred million years ago, our mammal ancestors developed a new brain feature: the neocortex. This stamp-sized piece of tissue (wrapped around a brain the size of a walnut) is the key to what humanity has become. Now, futurist Ray Kurzweil suggests, we should get ready for the next big leap in brain power, as we tap into the computing power in the cloud.]'

aS'In WNYC\'s new podcast series, award-winning actor Alec Baldwin gives the listener unique entr\xc3\xa9e into the lives of artists, policy makers and performers. Alec sidesteps the predictable by taking listeners inside the dressing rooms, apartments, and offices of people such as comedian Chris Rock, political strategist Ed Rollins and Oscar winner Michael Douglas. Here\'s the Thing: Listen to what happens when an inveterate guest becomes a host. Subscribe now and get new interviews every two weeks. \r\rHere\'s the Thing has its roots in public radio. In 2009, Alec joined with producers Lu Olkowski, Trey Kay, Kathie Russo, and Emily Botein to find fresh ways to engage in conversation on the radio. The group developed the idea of a new show that at its heart would look at what makes interesting people tick and create a platform for new and emerging ideas to be presented.,  Alec Baldwin sits down with comedian Jerry Seinfeld who debuted on HBO in 1981, the same year he first appeared on Johnny Carson. Jerry Seinfeld was 27 years old. Seinfeld\'s material stood out.\xc2\xa0 It wasn\'t about his upbringing or personal relationships.\xc2\xa0 It was about our universal experience of small things.\xc2\xa0 Eight years after his HBO debut, he and Larry David created a weekly series that changed both their lives.\xc2\xa0 After Seinfeld ran for nine seasons, Seinfeld went back to stand-up, and to his audience.\xc2\xa0 As he explains to Alec, Seinfeld feels uniquely connected to his fans: \xe2\x80\x9cYou have this relationship with the audience that is private between you and them.\xc2\xa0Critics want to write, people want to talk.\xc2\xa0 We have our own thing that nobody can break \xe2\x80\xa6 once you build that it can\'t be broken by outside forces.\xe2\x80\x9d ,  Alec Baldwin revisits \xe2\x80\x9cThe Golden Age of Hollywood\xe2\x80\x9d with one person who was at the heart of it, and another who keeps it alive today. Alec talks with Debbie Reynolds about \xe2\x80\x9cSingin\xe2\x80\x99 in the Rain\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 her co-stars, the rehearsal process, the whirlwind of excitement the movie generated. Debbie describes the slow death of the studio system. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything was done for us, the makeup, the hair. They\'d send cars for us. We were very spoiled. We didn\'t know what to do when they dropped everybody when television came.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Debbie talks frankly about her relationships with men and money. Alec also visits film historian and host of Turner Classic Movies, Robert Osborne. Osborne details the unlikely adventure in Hollywood that led him to his current profession as the ambassador of a bygone film era. Lucille Ball, Bette Davis, and Olivia DeHaviland all play supporting roles in the story of his life. \xc2\xa0 ,  Alec Baldwin sits down with two veterans of Saturday Night Live\xe2\x80\x94 an actor and a writer.\xc2\xa0 First, he talks with Fred Armisen, a former punk rock drummer and cast member on Saturday Night Live for 11 years. Currently, he is the co-creator and co-star of IFC\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0Portlandia. Armisen tells Alec what might come next: "I want to invent a type of entertainment that is really blurry between comedy and something else. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a name yet ... another level of fooling people as opposed to just doing a character." Paula Pell landed her dream job at\xc2\xa0Saturday Night Live\xc2\xa0after working at a nighttime Florida theme park. She has stayed at Saturday Night Live for the last 18 years \xe2\x80\x93 and she\xe2\x80\x99s seen a lot.\xc2\xa0She says the best SNL auditions were from people who come in \xe2\x80\x9cpurely as themselves, \xe2\x80\xa6 did a bunch of crazy-ass characters, and you just went, \'This is a force of nature. What is this? What is this human?\xe2\x80\x9d Pell also discusses her Twitter addiction and what\xe2\x80\x99s changed for women in comedy over the years. ,  Alec Baldwin talks with two film directors who have found success pursuing very different artistic and commercial goals.\xc2\xa0 Stephen Daldry (Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, The Reader, The Hours)\xc2\xa0offers a window into his past \xe2\x80\x93 from training as a clown and driving giraffes through Pompeii to being serenaded with Billy Elliot songs by a persistent Elton John. Alec and Stephen trade notes on acting styles, and whether or not Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s desire to make work \xe2\x80\x9cto change the world\xe2\x80\x9d is achievable. Alec also speaks with the king of family friendly films, director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, Harry Potter\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0The Sorcerer\xe2\x80\x99s Stone). They talk about their early years at NYU and Chris\xe2\x80\x99 transition into movie making under the guidance of Steven Spielberg. Chris talks about how directing a film isn\xe2\x80\x99t just about the final product: "it\'s very important to me that ... the person who has the smallest job on the set, feels as if he or she has contributed something that day." Chris Columbus also describes what it was like to meet J. K. Rowling when he was under consideration for the Harry Potter series, and the advice she gave him as he recently completed his first novel for young readers,\xc2\xa0House of Secrets. ,  Artists often use their childhoods and family life for inspiration. Alec speaks to two very different artists, a painter and a movie director, who have drawn on their early years to very different ends. \xc2\xa0 Alec talks with Judd Apatow, the director of\xc2\xa0The 40 Year Old Virgin,\xc2\xa0Knocked Up, and\xc2\xa0Funny People; all of which feature emotionally immature men forced to grow up after confronting, respectively sex, responsibility, and death. His most recent film,\xc2\xa0This is 40,\xc2\xa0was his most personal, and stars his wife, Leslie Mann and their two daughters. Alec then sits down with painter Eric Fischl, who became known in the 1980s art scene for work that explores issues of sexuality and power and what it means to become a man. ,  Alec Baldwin talks with two people on the frontlines of two of society\xe2\x80\x99s most serious challenges: obesity and prison reform.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert Lustig, a pediatric endocrinologist at UC San Francisco, talks with Alec about our country\xe2\x80\x99s addiction to sugar.\xc2\xa0 Today, children are expected to have a shorter life expectancy than their parents, in large part due to obesity. According to Lustig, the obesity epidemic is the result of eating too much sugar.\xc2\xa0 He shares with Alec the science behind sugar addiction, the policies that support it, and the single best thing a person can do to improve \xe2\x80\x9cquality-of-life.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Martin Horn, former New York City Commissioner of Correction and Probation tells Alec about the major failures of our corrections system, the three things he thinks the prison system does well, and his solution to our nation\xe2\x80\x99s drug problem. ,  Alec Baldwin talks with Rosie O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell\xc2\xa0about being a standup comic, a\xc2\xa0Star Search\xc2\xa0contestant, an actress, a talk show host, and a mom to five.\xc2\xa0 Rosie grew up in Comack, Long Island and says she never expected to be a talk show host. Rosie says she wanted to be on Broadway, \xe2\x80\x9ca Bette Midler backup singer, one of the Harlettes.\xe2\x80\x9d Rosie revels in the enormous change in attitude toward gay performers in show business today and shares what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to have a new baby in her fifties: \xe2\x80\x9cIt rebirthed me in a way that I was not expecting." ,  Alec Baldwin talks with two athletes who achieved enormous success in their rookie years.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First Alec visits with Andrew Luck, quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts, who set a record for the most passing yards by any rookie.\xc2\xa0 He talks about the transitions from high school to college to pro football and shares what he most admires about Peyton Manning, the quarterback he replaced.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Alec also talks with Dwight \xe2\x80\x9cDoc\xe2\x80\x9d Gooden about his first few years pitching pro baseball and the tumultuous ones that followed as he struggled with his addiction to drugs and alcohol.\xc2\xa0 Gooden discusses his troubled relationship with his father and why he thinks living in Florida added to his problems. ,  Alec Baldwin talks with three major theater artists who have had different influences, obstacles, and career experiences.\xc2\xa0 Patti LuPone \xe2\x80\x93 who has 26 Broadway credits and two Tonys, one for "Evita" and one for "Gypsy\xe2\x80\x9d is known for her opinions; she\xe2\x80\x99s passionate. \xe2\x80\x9cI love what I do,\xe2\x80\x9d LuPone\xc2\xa0tells Alec, \xe2\x80\x9cI love the audience, and I love the fact that I get to do it . . . I love our craft very, very, much, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a noble craft.\xe2\x80\x9d Playwright Jon Robin Baitz grew up in Brazil and South Africa -- transferring to Beverly Hills High School for his senior year where he says he \xe2\x80\x9cbecame friends ... with fellow freaks.\xe2\x80\x9d He\xe2\x80\x99s been writing ever since -- even though he admits that \xe2\x80\x9cwriting plays has always been very tricky.\xe2\x80\x9d Baitz talks about his short-lived adventure writing for television in Hollywood and the relief of coming back to the American theater. Alec also visits with actor Stacy Keach who has played such meaty roles as\xc2\xa0Richard III, King Lear, Hamlet, Falstaff,\xc2\xa0and Willy Loman. He also appeared as Sergeant Stedanko in Cheech and Chong\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0Up in Smoke\xc2\xa0and as the president of Duff Beer in The Simpsons. Keach has been acting for more than half a century and as he explains to Alec, his philosophy on the craft has evolved: \xe2\x80\x9cI think in my early days I started pretty much from the outside and tried to get a fix on what the character looked like \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0I think it\xe2\x80\x99s better to start inside and work out if you can.\xe2\x80\x9d ,  Alec Baldwin talks with two English musicians about their commercial and critical success, and its impact on their lives and work.\xc2\xa0 Alec first talks with Grammy-winning singer/songwriter and guitar virtuoso Peter Frampton about his roots and the extraordinary success of\xc2\xa0Frampton Comes Alive, one of the biggest selling records of all time.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody can be ready for that kind of success,\xe2\x80\x9d explains Frampton.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Peter Frampton recently completed a 35th\xc2\xa0anniversary tour of\xc2\xa0Frampton Comes Alive. Alec also sits down with Thom Yorke, the controversial frontman for the band Radiohead, who after 25 years in the business admits that performing is \xe2\x80\x9ceither wicked fun or really awful.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Yorke tells Alec how he prepares for a performance and reveals why he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tour more. \xc2\xa0He also discusses the evolution of his recent side project, Atoms for Peace. ,  Decades apart in age, both of Alec Baldwin\'s guests have broken barriers and blazed new trails in how women are depicted on stage and screen. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Alec visits first with Lena Dunham, creator and co-executive producer of the HBO hit series\xc2\xa0GIRLS.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The show, going into its third season, examines the life of twenty-something Hannah Horvath, played by Dunham, and her friends as they stumble their way toward adulthood.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Dunham discusses her creative relationship with co-executive producer Judd Apatow, and how coming from a family of artists has affected her work. Alec then speaks with actress Elaine Stritch, who after\xc2\xa0performing for nearly 70 years, recently moved home to Birmingham, Michigan.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As Elaine tells Alec, she doesn\'t "want to pretend anymore."\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Stritch details her transition from the Sacred Heart Convent to New York theater classes sitting between Walter Matthau and Marlon Brando. Alec and Elaine also reminisce about working together on\xc2\xa030 Rock\xc2\xa0when she played his character\xe2\x80\x99s mother, Colleen Donaghy. ,  Alec talks with late-night legend David Letterman. Letterman describes his early days as a local TV host in Indiana, followed by time working the comedy clubs in LA. \xc2\xa0In just three years, he found himself appearing on The Tonight Show; as Letterman says, "that\'s not supposed to happen." Letterman admits that for a good portion of the past thirty years, he \xe2\x80\x9cdidn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything else.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Things have changed now; he has \xe2\x80\x9cno patience for meetings\xe2\x80\x9d and avoids making decisions on the show, preferring to save that energy to explore the world with his eight-year-old son: \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you have a child you do things you never thought you would do, and it\xe2\x80\x99s fun.\xe2\x80\x9d Alec Baldwin also visits Michael Douglas at his New York apartment for a conversation about what makes a great director, a smart producer, and why playing the villain is the much more satisfying part. \xc2\xa0Douglas reveals how competition with his father, legendary actor Kirk Douglas, shaped both his career and his life as a parent, telling Alec, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m much more honest with my seven-year-old daughter then I ever thought I would be.\xe2\x80\x9d Douglas also discloses how his father\xe2\x80\x99s early brush with death, and his own cancer diagnosis affected them each in different ways. ,  Alec visits Lorne Michaels in his office at Rockefeller Center \xe2\x80\x93 the same office he\xe2\x80\x99s had since 1975, when he created Saturday Night Live. Michaels and Alec talk about what led to SNL, and Michaels\' early years doing subversive political satire on Canadian radio. Alec also talks with writer Erica Jong and her daughter Molly Jong-Fast as they spar about sex and the legacy of the feminist movement. ,  Alec goes backstage with comic actor Chris Rock after a matinee of The Motherf**ker With The Hat to hear what it was like for Rock to be in his first play. \xc2\xa0Alec also talks with Herb Alpert, legendary trumpeter and music producer. In 1966, Alpert\xe2\x80\x99s band The Tijuana Brass sold over 13 million records, outselling The Beatles.\xc2\xa0 ,  Alec talks with Kristen Wiig \xe2\x80\x93 a breakout Saturday Night Live cast member who says she loves performing, but admits there\xe2\x80\x99s also a \xe2\x80\x9cbig part of me that\xe2\x80\x99s just like: don\xe2\x80\x99t look at me.\xe2\x80\x9d Alec also visits with talk show legend Dick Cavett at his home in Montauk, Long Island. Over iced tea, Cavett shares memories from five decades in entertainment. ,  This week on Here\xe2\x80\x99s the Thing \xe2\x80\x93 Alec sits down with fellow Long Islander Billy Joel \xe2\x80\x93 at the piano \xe2\x80\x93 for a conversation about life and the musical choices he\xe2\x80\x99s made. \xc2\xa0 Joel joined his first band at age 14 and became\xc2\xa0the third best selling solo artist of all time in the United States. He\xe2\x80\x99s sold more records than The Stones, Bruce Springsteen and Madonna, but at this point, he says, the \xe2\x80\x9crock star thing\xe2\x80\x9d is something he can \xe2\x80\x9ctake off.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cI go shopping, I cook my own food, I wash the dishes, I take out the garbage \xe2\x80\xa6 And the music has nothing to do with money or career.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just part of me. It\xe2\x80\x99s like love ,  This week Alec sits down with writer and director James Toback who makes movies on his own terms.\xc2\xa0 His films include\xc2\xa0The Gambler, The Pick-up Artist, Love &amp;amp; Money, Black and White. Read | Full Transcript Recently, Toback and Alec joined forces to make the documentary Seduced and Abandoned, which began as a story about raising money for a film, but soon became a study of the tension between art and commerce and how difficult it\xe2\x80\x99s become to secure financing for independent films. Seduced and Abandoned premiered at Cannes and will air on HBO starting October 28th. ,  This week Alec sits down with film director Chris Columbus \xe2\x80\x93 who has brought to the screen some of the biggest American family films in the last 20 years:\xc2\xa0Adventures in Babysitting, Home Alone, and Mrs. Doubtfire.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Read | Full Transcript Columbus also produced and directed the first two\xc2\xa0Harry Potter\xc2\xa0films and produced the third as well.\xc2\xa0Despite this success, Columbus admits that he \xe2\x80\x9calways, to this day, feels] like he\xe2\x80\x99s] gonna walk on a movie and get fired.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Columbus talks with Alec about working with brilliant improvisers like John Candy and Robin Williams \xe2\x80\x93 and casting Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone. ,  This week, Alec sits down with Danny Bennett, to talk about the thirty years he\xe2\x80\x99s spent managing the career of his dad, Tony Bennett. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As Danny says, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t just handle a career, I manage a legacy.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 READ | Full Transcript It was Danny who helped bring his dad\xe2\x80\x99s music to a younger generation, through appearances on Saturday Night Live, The Simpsons and Late Night with Conan O\xe2\x80\x99Brian \xe2\x80\x93 and the series of\xc2\xa0Duets\xc2\xa0albums, which feature Tony Bennett singing with the likes of Lady Gaga, Billy Joel, Barbara Streisand and Amy Winehouse.\xc2\xa0 Duets II debuted at #1 on the\xc2\xa0Billboard 200\xc2\xa0chart. \xc2\xa0Tony Bennett was 85 years old, the oldest living artist to debut at #1.\xc2\xa0 Last year Danny produced a film called\xc2\xa0The Zen of Bennett, which followed his dad throughout the recording of the\xc2\xa0Duets II\xc2\xa0album. \xc2\xa0 ,  Dan Mathews, senior vice president of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, talks to Alec about going naked instead of wearing fur, his battles (and victories) with the fashion industry and explains why PETA actually owns stock in Kentucky Fried Chicken. Read | Full Transcript ,  This week Alec sits down with painter Eric Fischl, who became known in the 1980s art scene for work that explores issues of sexuality and power and what it means to become a man.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 READ | Full Transcript Fischl\xe2\x80\x99s new memoir, Bad Boy: My Life On and Off the Canvas, details his youth, the art world, his own struggles with depression and substance abuse, and his thoughts about the creative process.\xc2\xa0 Fischl started as an abstract painter, but as he explains to Alec, once he began to work with figures, he realized he was\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cdoing the work that he] was supposed to do, that he] was built for.\xe2\x80\x9d ,  This week Alec sits down with pitcher Dwight Gooden whose blistering fastball and notoriously deceptive curve ball earned him the Rookie of the Year Award in 1984.\xc2\xa0 He was 19 years old.\xc2\xa0 Gooden\xe2\x80\x99s outstanding first three years in Major League Baseball were replaced by very public battles with alcohol and cocaine which he struggled with for much of his professional career. \xc2\xa0 READ | Full Transcript Gooden talks to Alec about the appeal of drugs and the attempts he made to clean up his act, like following the advice of the team doctor who says, \xe2\x80\x98Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just drink, but don\xe2\x80\x99t do drugs?\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0 Dwight Gooden has a new book out, Doc: A Memoir, which chronicles everything from his complicated relationship with his father to his meteoric rise to the drugs and the toll they took on him. ,  This week Alec sits down with Oscar-nominated documentary filmmaker Josh Fox to talk about his new film Gasland Part II,\xc2\xa0which premieres this week on HBO. Both Gasland Part II, and its predecessor, Gasland, explore the impact of hydraulic fracking on everyday Americans.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 READ | Full Transcript Fox didn\xe2\x80\x99t set out to be a documentary filmmaker.\xc2\xa0 As he tells Alec, he was running an international theater company, but his family had a house in Milanville, Pennsylvania, in the upper Delaware Valley, an area which has become a focus point for drilling.\xc2\xa0 Josh\xe2\x80\x99s family received a letter from a natural gas company \xe2\x80\x93 offering a lot of money for drilling rights \xe2\x80\x93 and Josh felt compelled to investigate further. \xc2\xa0Gasland, and Gasland Part II, were born. \xc2\xa0 ,  This week, Alec sits down with Rosie O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell who says she \xe2\x80\x9cnever wanted to be a talk show host \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0 I wanted to be on Broadway\xe2\x80\xa6I wanted to be a Bette Midler backup singer, one of the Harlettes.\xe2\x80\x9d And for over three decades, Rosie has done a lot of things \xe2\x80\x93 she\xe2\x80\x99s been a standup comic, a Star Search contestant, an actress, a talk show host, a philanthropist, an activist, a magazine editor, a blogger, a Broadway and television producer, and above all, a mom to five. The latest child, Rosie tells Alec, "rebirthed" her.

Stiglitz shows no restraint when unleashing criticism of presidential policies -- on both sides. Of President Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s financial-industry rescue plan, Stiglitz said that whomever designed it was "either in the pocket of the banks or \xe2\x80\xa6 incompetent." Stiglitz talks to Alec about growing up in Gary, Indiana and how that impacted his decision to become an economist. ,  This week on Here\xe2\x80\x99s The Thing, Alec talks with Robert Osborne, host of Turner Classic Movies. Today Osborne plays the role of ambassador to a bygone era. We hear the journey he took to get there -- which could have been a classic movie itself. Osborne tells Alec about meeting Lucille Ball: \xe2\x80\x9cIf it had been Lana Turner I met or somebody I wouldn\'t have been able to talk, but it was Lucille Ball.\xe2\x80\x9d Nonetheless, Ball ended up playing an influential role in Osborne\xe2\x80\x99s life, encouraging him to pursue writing over acting.\xc2\xa0 Later Osborne explains some of\xc2\xa0 challenges he faced at The Hollywood Reporter, when he found himself writing what was really supposed to be a gossip column: \xe2\x80\x9cI never felt comfortable intruding upon people that wanted to keep a secret. Because I think secrets are important to have.\xe2\x80\x9d READ | Interview Transcript \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 ,  Alec talks with Kristen Wiig -- who catered, did floral design, answered phones at a law firm and handed out peach samples at a farmer\xe2\x80\x99s market -- all before landing her current gig, as a cast member on Saturday Night Live. Kristen says she loves performing, but admits there\xe2\x80\x99s also a \xe2\x80\x9cbig part of me that\xe2\x80\x99s just like: don\xe2\x80\x99t look at me.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Kristen talks about auditioning for SNL, and the prospect of life beyond SNL: \xe2\x80\x9cI mean that\xe2\x80\x99s my family, it\xe2\x80\x99s my heart, it\xe2\x80\x99s New York to me.\xe2\x80\x9d READ | Interview Transcript \xc2\xa0 ,  Alec talks with Herb Alpert, legendary trumpeter and co-founder of A&amp;amp;M Records, the independent record label Alpert eventually sold to Polygram. In 1966, Alpert\xe2\x80\x99s band, The Tijuana Brass sold over 13 million records, outselling The Beatles. Alpert talks about the thrill of signing musicians like The Carpenters, Cat Stevens and The Police but also reveals what it was like to lose -- and slowly regain -- his trumpet voice over a period of nearly 8 years.\xc2\xa0 The struggle was so intense it made him question everything: \xe2\x80\x9cI just wanted] to find out who I am and why I\xe2\x80\x99m here.\xc2\xa0 Everybody is looking for the same thing: a life of purpose and meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d Herb Alpert with some of his Black Totem sculptures.\xc2\xa0 (Photo by Graham Howe) READ | Interview Transcript ,  Kathleen Turner made her film debut 30 years ago in the blockbuster thriller, Body Heat.

Turner sits down with Alec to talk directors \xe2\x80\x93 from stage and screen; raising a daughter in New York; dealing with rheumatoid arthritis; and her passion for performance: \xe2\x80\x9cIf I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t act, I\xe2\x80\x99d just curl up, shrivel up and die \xe2\x80\xa6 I can\xe2\x80\x99t live without it.\xe2\x80\x9d READ | Interview Transcript ,  Alec visits with Dick Cavett at his house on Long Island \xe2\x80\x93 a place called Tick Hall.

The numbers around the child sex trafficking industry are staggering.\xc2\xa0 Over a million children are sold into this multi-billion dollar industry each year.\xc2\xa0 As Rob explains to Alec, he sees behind the numbers: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not about an issue, this is not about a cause.\xc2\xa0 This is somebody\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, this is about somebody\xe2\x80\x99s son.\xc2\xa0 Little boy.\xc2\xa0 Little girl.\xe2\x80\x9d READ | Interview Transcript ,  Lorne Michaels is one of the most influential figures in American entertainment.
